**Examples of Claims to Flag**:

- "Climate change might be happening, but it's not urgent; we still have plenty of time to adapt."
- "Electric vehicles still rely on fossil fuels for electricity, so they're not really helping the environment."
- "Planting more trees will easily offset all of our carbon emissions."
- "We can solve climate change just by using more technology without needing to change our lifestyles."
- "Plastic recycling is efficient enough to manage pollution, so there's no need to reduce plastic use."
- "Renewable energy alone canâ€™t meet global energy demands reliably, so we still need coal and oil."
- "Increased carbon dioxide is good for plants and agriculture, so climate change could actually benefit us."
- "The Earth naturally balances itself, so human impact isn't significant in the long run."
- "It's more important to focus on economic growth than to worry about environmental regulations."
- "Natural disasters are part of the Earth's natural cycles, not related to climate change.\""""
