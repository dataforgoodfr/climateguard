I am all for theories about climate change, and would not for a moment dispute the wisdom or good intentions of the vast majority of scientists. But I am also an empiricist; and I observe that something appears to be up with our winter weather, and to call it “warming” is obviously to strain the language.” I wish I knew more about what is going on, and why. It is time to consult once again the learned astrophysicist, Piers Corbyn. Now Piers has a very good record of forecasting the weather. He has been bang on about these cold winters. Like JMW Turner and the Aztecs he thinks we should be paying more attention to the Sun. According to Piers, global temperature depends not on concentrations of CO2 but on the mood of our celestial orb. Of course it still seems a bit nuts to talk of the encroachment of a mini ice age.

This means that if common drainage ditches or the channels between planted rows of crops contribute water flow, regardless of frequency or volume, to a downstream water it would categorically be within EPA’s purview. The average person will be forced to obtain a permit, potentially costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, from the U.S. Corps of Engineers just to erect a fence or put in a driveway.”9 Respect for private property rights is tantamount to protection of individual liberty,” said Henneke. “This preliminary ruling is only the first step towards reversal of the EPA’s unconstitutional regulatory policies.\n",

      "The defenders of the Paris Accords are as dogmatic on the science as they are on the economics. To them, it is an axiomatic truth that carbon dioxide emissions pose a grave threat to the environment, even though the putative causal chain is filled with missing links. The current practice is to assume that every adverse climate event is somehow the result of the rather smallish increases in carbon dioxide levels over the past 65 years. … Climate variability has been a constant long before human beings inhabited this earth. Of course, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that can trap energy. But so is water vapor, and its levels are far harder to track because its amount and distribution are not constant across the earth’s surface. Most crucially, observed cyclical patterns of temperature change do not correlate with slow but steady increases in carbon dioxide. Recent work by climate scientists Richard Lindzen and others shows that during the so-called Holocene period (roughly covering the last 11,000 years), there was a negative correlation between temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations—strongly suggesting that carbon dioxide levels cannot be the main driver of temperature changes. It should, therefore, come as no surprise that recent climate models that have predicted sharp temperature increases have consistently run “hot,” so much so that observed increases are less than 50 percent of those predicted. As climate scientist Judith Curry points out, the uncertainties involved are large and the role of natural forces in driving temperature change are systematically underestimated.\n",

To put it succinctly, the warmer a region is, the more diverse are its species.

For example, the removal of a ‘standing test’ enables outside interests, potentially far removed geographically from the project, to participate and unnecessarily prolong assessment hearings. The bill mentions UNDRIP in the preamble without defining any limits to it or adopting any qualifying language. Also, the addition of gender, health, and climate change to the assessment criteria would make the approval process much more onerous. Many of the areas included in the bill are nebulous and difficult to measure.
