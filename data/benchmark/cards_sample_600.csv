"On June 15, 15 Republican state attorneys general wrote a letter to the so-called ""AGs United for Clean Power"" on the letter head of Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange.The opening of the letter:Several state Attorneys General recently held a press conference under the banner of ""AGs United for Clean Power."" The media event highlighted an investigation into ""whether fossil fuel companies misled investors and the public on the impact of climate change on their businesses."" We think this effort by our colleagues to police the global warming debate through the power of the subpoena is a grave mistake.We all understand the need for a healthy environment, but we represent a wide range of viewpoints regarding the extent to which man contributes to climate change and the costs and benefits of any proposed fix. Nevertheless, we agree on at least one thing this is not a question for the courts. Using law enforcement authority to resolve a public policy debate undermines the trust invested in our offices and threatens free speech.We are concerned that our colleagues' investigation undermines the trust the people have invested in Attorneys General to investigate fraud. Investigatory subpoenas were issued to at least one company and one non-profit believed to have made statements minimizing the risks of climate change. At the press conference, one of our colleagues noted that ""e are pursuing this as we would any other fraud matter."" We routinely investigate fraud, and have done so with many of the states present at the press conference. But this investigation is far from routine. We are unaware of any fraud case combining the following three characteristics: 1) the investigation targets a particular type of market participant; 2) the Attorneys General identify themselves with the competitors of their investigative targets; and 3) the investigation implicates an ongoing public policy debate.Read the rest at the link above.",0_accepted,cards

"As EPA's own data show, despite allegedly ""unprecedented"" warming, U.S. air quality has improved decade-by-decade since 1970 as emissions declined. The report blames climate change for the Midwest drought of 2012. But the government's own analysis concluded otherwise: ""Neither ocean states nor human-induced climate change, factors that can provide long-lead predictability, appeared to play significant roles in causing severe rainfall deficits over the major corn producing regions of central Great Plains."" The Assessment ignores substantial data and research finding no long-term increase in the strength and frequency of tropical cyclones and no trend in extreme weather-related damages once losses are ""normalized' (adjusted for changes in population, wealth, and consumer price index).",1_its_not_happening,cards
"Compared with the likely benefits to both human health and food production from CO2-induced global warming, the possible disadvantages from, say, a slight increase in either the frequency or the intensity of extreme weather events is very small beer. It is, in fact, still uncertain whether there is any impact on extreme weather events as a result of warming (increased carbon emissions, which have certainly occurred, cannot on their own affect the weather: it is only warming which might). The unusual persistence of heavy rainfall over the UK during February, which led to considerable flooding, is believed by the scientists to have been caused by the wayward behaviour of the jetstream; and there is no credible scientific theory that links this behaviour to the fact that the earth's surface is some 0.8C warmer than it was 150 years ago.",1_its_not_happening,cards
"Debates about those claims revolve around several contentious issues. Key among these are: whether there is, in fact, reason for alarm; what reliable evidence supports that supposition; i.e., what degrees of impact do human have versus natural influences on global temperature changes (both warming and cooling); and what trends can be observed and projected to guide prudent responses? It is not my intent to argue that the global climate has been cooling since the late 1970s, but merely to present a case that there is no convincing evidence that it has been warming.",1_its_not_happening,cards
"Dr. Santer also thinks that volcanic aerosols are an important factor in the hiatus, but probably only up to 25%. He acknowledges that natural long term cycles (mainly the AMO and the PDO ) may contribute significantly, but these are poorly understood and not in the models.

Dyson said his skepticism about those computer models was borne out by recent reports of a study by Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading in Great Britain that showed global temperatures were flat between 2000 and 2010 even though we humans poured record amounts of CO-2 into the atmosphere during that decade.,1_its_not_happening,cards

The global surface temperature record appears to be made of natural specific oscillations with a likely solar/astronomical origin plus a noncyclical anthropogenic contribution during the last decades. Indeed, because the boundary condition of the climate system is regulated also by astronomical harmonic forcings, the astronomical frequencies need to be part of the climate signal in the same way the tidal oscillations are regulated by soli-lunar harmonics.",2_its_not_us,cards

It is also clear that the climate of the Earth's polar regions are linked.

Date from Siple Dome (West Antarctica) and the Greenland Ice Sheet Project ice core climate proxies for northern and southern circumpolar westerlies show remarkably concurrent major intensification periods between 6000 and 5000 years ago and starting 1200 600 years ago. It appears that Antarctic events start earlier and less abruptly than those in Greenland.,2_its_not_us,cards
It is beyond my comprehension why anyone would seek to force fit an alternative explanation based on CO2 since 1975/particulates from 1940-1970/solar forcing before 1940 etc. when the ENSO explanation explains the temperature trend extremely well and much more elegantly.,2_its_not_us,cards
"Now, the average of this system, the whole atmosphere and surface included together, is what should have the global average temperature of -18 degrees C, and it does, because the temperature goes from warm (+15 degrees C) at the bottom of the atmosphere, to cold (-70 degrees C) at the top of the atmosphere, and measured from space it is -18 degrees C on average. The bottom of the atmosphere is warmest because that is where the Sun does the real-time physical heating in the first place. The temperature decreases with altitude because the heat dissipates outwards from the ground and cools down, and also because of the natural adiabatic gradient. The amount of water vapour in the air-column reduces the adiabatic gradient and it also reduces night-time cooling, because of latent heat which is trapped and then released by the H2O molecules. -And to be sure, those H2O molecules wouldnt be able to get into the air-column if sunshine was freezing cold at -18 degrees C!- Finally, the natural existence of the adiabatic gradient (that is, the fact that the air has to cool with altitude), means that the bottom of the atmosphere must be warmer than top and therefore the bottom must also be warmer than the average. If the average has to be -18 degrees C, then this average has to be found between the bottom (warmest) and the top (coldest), and the bottom will naturally be warmer than that average.

Clearly human pollution (not greenhouse gases) is a problem.

Gerald Bond found evidence of cosmogenic isotope changes at each of a long series of warming followed by cooling events (he has able to track 25 events through current interglacial Holocene and into the last glacial period, at which point he reached the limit of the range of the proxy analysis technique) which indicates a solar magnetic cycle change caused the warming followed by cooling cycle.",2_its_not_us,cards

"These results agree with the evidence mustered by Hoyt and Schatten and Georgieva, Kirov, and Bianchi for a phase shift circa 1920 in the relationship between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures. However, we can suggest, here, that the supposed negative correlation between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures prior to 1920 rests on a misconstrued understanding of the data. As can be seen in Figure 6, the relationship between the change in the warming rate and solar activity is still positive, i.e. the warming rate is peaking near the peaks of solar cycles 10, 12, and 14, but at a much reduced level, indicative of the lower level of solar activity during the period. Indeed, for much of solar cycle 12, and all of solar cycle 14, the warming rate is negative, but the change in the warming rate is still following the level of solar activity, becoming less negative as solar activity increases, and more negative as solar activity decreases. Still, there is a strong suggestion in Figure 6 of a phase shift circa 1920 in which the relationship between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures changes dramatically before and after the shift. Before the shift, the lunar period dominates, and the solar period is much weaker. After the shift, the solar period dominates, and the lunar period becomes subordinate.",2_its_not_us,cards

The rate was faster over 1993 to 2003: about 3.1 mm per year. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variability or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear. There is high confidence that the rate of observed sea level rise increased from the 19th to the 20th century. The IPCC crew reminds us that Global average sea level in the last interglacial period (about 125,000 years ago) was likely 4 to 6 m higher than during the 20th century, mainly due to the retreat of polar ice.

"Baffin Bay population. The IUCN says that the initial estimate (1984-1989) for this subpopulation was 300 to 600 bears. A second survey (1993 to 1997) estimated this declining population to be 2,074 bears. Please note that the previous two sentences are not the result of some bizarre typo. The extremely low initial numbers were presumably due to a flawed methodology (data collected in the spring in which the capture effort was restricted to shore-fast ice and the floe edge off northeast Baffin Island while recent work has shown that an unknown proportion of the subpopulation is typically offshore during the spring) How can the IUCN confidently conclude that this subpopulation is decreasing? Because the current (2004) estimate based on simulations is that the population is 1,600 bears. The reason for the decline is that the subpopulation appears to be substantially over-harvested. One of the reasons that it is over-harvested is that in 2004 Nunavut increased its hunting quota from 64 to 105 bears per year because reports from Inuit hunters that polar bear numbers in BB had grown substantially.

"Elevated CO 2 did not significantly impact vegetative growth in three of these weedy species. For Spergula arvensis , however, atmospheric CO 2 enrichment increased maximum leaf length by an average of 15%, regardless of light treatment, and total dry weight by 20 and 68% at full and reduced light levels, respectively. Similarly, elevated CO 2 significantly enhanced reproductive success in only one of these species, by increasing the number of seeds in Poa annua by 50 and 26% at full and reduced light levels, respectively. Thus, CO 2 -induced increases in vegetative biomass do not necessarily lead to increases in reproductive biomass, and CO 2 -induced increases in reproductive biomass do not need to be preceded by increases in vegetative biomass. In contrast to the limited significant effects of elevated CO 2 on vegetative and reproductive growth, reduced light nearly always caused significant decreases in plant vegetative and reproductive success. Moreover, the negative effects of reduced light on these parameters were typically much stronger than any positive effect resulting from atmospheric CO 2 enrichment. Total plant dry weights, for example, decreased by 32 to 62%, depending upon species, when grown in reduced, rather than in full light, while atmospheric CO 2 enrichment only increased total plant dry weights by 2 to 30%.

In addition, the air temperature increase had little effect on soil organic carbon content, boosting it by only 1%.

"The most impressive thing about this summer's vaunted droughtcalled an ""ultra-drought"" by CBS icon Dan Ratheris that it wasn't one. Whereas Rather called this a ""summer to survive"" in the Midwest, it actually looked more like a summer to grow.Illinois experienced what is at least its third-wettest June (records go back to 1895). Toward the end of June, the entire state of Illinois, 90 percent of Missouri and Wisconsin, and half of Iowa were reporting unusually moist conditions. We think that qualifies as the ""Midwest.""But why should we be surprised by this spate of climate hyperbole? That kind of drought hype is about as repetitive as Vice President Al Gore saying ""risky."" Last summer, for example, we were bombarded with the same story, even though less of the country than normal was experiencing a significant moisture shortage. Both the ostensible drought and forecasts of more of the same were based upon the appearance of La Nia (unusually cold) conditions in the tropical Pacific.Going back just another year, recall the agricultural disasters predicted because of El Nio, the warm phase of this common Pacific oscillation. One major network featured brown cornstalks and a cloud of dust in August. That was in Texas, where corn is normally brown in August, given that it's planted early in the year. As for the dust, it was kicked up by a harvester plucking fat ears.The beating goes on and on. And what we find most interesting is that people continue to eat. Well and cheaply, we might add. What gives?Let's stipulate that supply and demand determine price. For food, the latter is increasing because there is a larger number of demanding mouths to feed. Everything else being equal, the price of food should increase slightly as a result of that. But adding in the effect of the 2000 drought, the 1999 drought, the 1998 drought, and so forth should be as calamitous as the Network News.In an attempt to verify all these terrible stories, we plotted out the price of corn in dollars per bushel, allowing for inflation. What is immediately obvious is that the price of corn is lower than it has ever been. Despite all the weather gloom and doom, as well as the population increase, the relative supply of the most important crop produced by the most important agricultural nation in history must be increasing.Our greener pals keep blaming us for the fact that Americans just don't seem to care about global warming. But perhaps they ought to look in the mirror. Constantly hawking weather disasters has a way of losing its credibility in the face of agricultural abundance.It is absurd to conflate warming with food shortages. The corn yield history was virtually steady for the first half of the twentieth century, followed by a dramatic rise in the second half. Today, one acre of land produces almost four times as much corn as it did 100 years ago.During that same time, U.S. temperatures varied considerably from year to year and decade to decade. Obviously, there is little if any correspondence between the nation's temperatures and its crop yields.What warming the United States has seen in the last three decades has been primarily in winter and, within that season, largely confined to the coldest air massesa prediction from greenhouse theory that the climate Cassandras rarely tout. A temperature change of this sort is beneficial for crops because it lengthens their growing season.Another benefit for crop production is the ever-increasing atmospheric level of carbon dioxide. We can certainly assert with confidence that the presence of additional carbon dioxide is responsible for about 10 percent of this abundant harvest.The evidence is in. Today's climate is a boon to agricultureno matter what you may hear on the evening news.ReferencesMichaels, P.J., et al., 2000. Observed warming in cold anticyclones.

"When I hear concerns about soil erosion, I always think about my grandma. She was an amazing woman. She grew up in Huron in the heart of the Great Depression, which just happened to coincide with the Dust Bowl. Growing up, my sister and I listened to her stories of dealing with the dust storms, stuffing rags in the window sills and the cracks around the doors in an attempt to keep the dust out of the house. Despite her best efforts, a fine film of dust would still cover the interior of the house.The dust from the Dust Bowl claimed crops, cattle, and the lives of two children in Huron. To this day, when contractors cut into houses that survived the Dust Bowl, they find sand in between the interior and exterior walls. The Dust Bowl eroded more than the soil; it eroded a way of life.Erosion is a problem that persists to this day, and it's responsible for dust storms, mudslides and sinkholes. Fortunately, plants in forests, grasslands, and everywhere else set roots in the soil and help the soil stay put, and plants around the globe are getting a boost from increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Although many people, spurred by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, think ""going green"" means using less carbon dioxide, plants prefer just the opposite.We all know plants need carbon dioxide to breathe, but many don't know plants turn that carbon dioxide into carbon in the form of the roots, stems, trunks, branches, leaves, and fruit with which we are more familiar. And according to a new study by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, the more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the greener the planet gets.The report, Climate Change Reconsidered II: Biological Impacts, published by The Heartland Institute (where I am a research fellow), cites thousands of peer-reviewed studies rising atmospheric CO2 levels are helping almost all plants grow bigger, become more efficient in using water, and better withstand the stress of high air temperature.In a way, this CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere is to plants like an oxygen mask is to a winded football player helping to prepare him for the next play.More CO2 in the atmosphere also means plants start to grow in places they couldn't before, reducing the amount of erosion and, consequently, dust in the air in places around the globe, while increasing the potential for agriculture and wildlife habitat as the range of certain plant species expands.Increased levels of CO2 also have been found to increase the fine-root density in some plants by up to 184 percent, and a 55 percent increase in above ground biomass despite water and nutrition limitations meaning plants become better at anchoring the soil in place and allowing water to permeate the surface, which is especially important during droughts.This would have been great news for my grandma and everyone else who survived the Dust Bowl. Improved farming techniques have played an important part in reducing the amount of erosion around the world, and these efforts certainly will be helped by having more CO2 in the atmosphere. Instead of being a detriment to plant growth, more CO2 acts as a fertilizer, making plants grow bigger, faster, more resilient, and more abundant, greening the world we live in.",3_its_not_bad,cards

Quoting them again, they say that ""the CMIP5 decadal simulations of rainfall exhibit very low skill when assessed across Australia and across a range of time-scales from yearly to longer which extend to the entire decade."" And it is this finding that leads them to ultimately conclude that the current state of precipitation predictability ""is not enough to drive impact models at decadal timescales and to influence policy and decision making.""",5_science_is_unreliable,cards

"Climate realists are generally willing to assume, for the sake of argument, that the Earth has warmed somewhat in recent decades. In fact, though, it is not obvious that even this modest claim is true. Satellite data show no net warming for as long as such data have been collected, i.e., back to 1979. Ocean measurements show no net warming over that period, either; the evidence for warming is based on land measurements. But the accuracy of land measurements depends on proper siting and maintenance of weather stations. One obvious factor is the urban heat island effect: many weather stations are located in cities, which grow warmer as more people and buildings accumulate. Thus, increasing temperatures at such stations may be measuring urban development rather than the climate. We all know that the urban heat island effect is realchance of frost in outlying areasyet the data that alarmists rely upon do not take it into account.",5_science_is_unreliable,cards

"Finally we come to nonsense variables argument made by Burger and Cubasch. Their basic argument here appears to be that CFR methods such as those used by Mann et al (1998), Rutherford et al (2005) and dozens of other groups of climate and paleoclimate researchers, are somehow prone to statistical overfitting in the presence of trends, which leads to the calibration of false relationships between predictors and predictand. So their above claim can be restated as follows: calibration using CFR methods such as Rutherford et al (2005) and multiproxy networks with the attributes (e.g. spatial locations and signal-vs-noise characteristics) similar to those of the proxy network used by Rutherford et al (2005) will produce unreliable reconstructions if the calibration period includes a substantial trend. They believe that such conditions will necessarily lead to the selection of nonsense predictors in reconstructing past variations from the available predictor network.",5_science_is_unreliable,cards
"Given the inadequacies of current climate models, how should we interpret the multi-model ensemble simulations of the 21 st century climate used in the IPCC assessment reports? This ensemble-of-opportunity is comprised of models with generally similar structures but different parameter choices and calibration histories. McWilliams (2007) and Parker (2010) argue that current climate model ensembles are not designed to sample representational uncertainty in a thorough or strategic way. Stainforth et al. (2007) argue that model inadequacy and an inadequate number of simulations in the ensemble preclude producing meaningful probability density functions (PDFs) from the frequency of model outcomes of future climate. Nevertheless, as summarized by Parker (2010), it is becoming increasingly common for results from individual multi-model and perturbed-physics simulations to be transformed into probabilistic projections of future climate, using Bayesian and other techniques. Parker argues that the reliability of these probabilistic projections is unknown, and in many cases they lack robustness. Knutti et al. (2008) argues that the real challenge lies more in how to interpret the PDFs rather whether they should be constructed in the first place. Stainforth et al. (2007) warns against over interpreting current model results since they could be contradicted by the next generation of models, undermining the credibility of the new generation of model simulations.",5_science_is_unreliable,cards
