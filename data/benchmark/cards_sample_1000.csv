"A coalition of environmental advocacy groups is pushing for the implementation of a federally financed environmentalist agenda in the curricula of all public schools.The benign-sounding No Child Left Inside Act, HB 3036, won U.S. House of Representatives approval on a 294-109 vote September 19, with only one Democrat (Rep. Brad Ellsworth of Indiana) opposed and two ranking Republicans on the Education Committee (Reps. Howard McKeon of California and Michael Castle of Delaware) in support.Congress went into fall recess before the Senate acted on the measure, but the bill could be integrated with the No Child Left Behind reauthorization next year or attached to a spending bill in the post-election lame-duck session.Two dozen environmental groups, led by the Sierra Club and Chesapeake Bay Foundation, are lobbying for the measure, which would award grants for integrating environmentalist precepts into curricula, academic standards, and teacher preparation.The money could go not just to school districts but to the very nonprofit advocacy organizations working to pass the bill.Objectivity Voted DownBy a 230-172 vote, the House rejected an amendment proposed by Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) that would have barred lobbying groups from receiving the grants and would have sought scientific accuracy and balance in what students were taught about the environment through the funded programs.The coalition's Web site, hosted by the Chesapeake Bay group, indicates the slant it would seek in classrooms by defining ""the problem"" as, among other things, climate change, childhood obesity, and something called ""nature-deficit disorder.""That is a term author Richard Louv coined in his book Last Child in the Woods, where he argued children are losing touch with the natural world and hence becoming vulnerable to maladies such as attention deficit disorder, depression, and obesity.The theory is an intriguing (if unproven) one, but should Washington take over from parents, churches, and community groups the task of taking kids out on hikes to commune with nature?Humans BlamedAs for climate change, the coalition asserts, ""the issue of global climate change requires Americans to understand the human-created challenges facing our world and the options facing our nation moving forward. It is projected that major societal change will be needed in response to global warming. To that end, each of us may be called upon to make changes to reduce the impact on the environment.""That statement assumes global warming is occurring as a result of the activities of man, and that drastic, mandatory changes in modern living will be necessary to curb it. Clearly, the federally funded curriculum would side with the forces led by former Vice President Al Gore falsely contending the science is settled on all this and no room exists for debate.If enacted, No Child Left Inside, the chief sponsor of which is Maryland Democrat Rep. John Sarbanes, would require state grant recipients to show how they were measuring ""student environmental literacy"" and instilling environmental know-how in teachers. Advocacy groups receiving grants would design their own evaluation and accountability plans.Important Story OverlookedIn a September 22 statement, EdWatch Action, a citizens group in Minnesota, called HB 3036 an ""unconstitutional expansion of the federal government into the realm of education that promotes unscientific, non-academic, politically correct environmental propaganda.""The environmental standards, curriculum, and programs funded by this bill that are to be put in every subject would take valuable time and resources from core academic issues,"" the group continued. ""The grants also promote programs that are supposed to teach bogus, subjective, and political concepts like self-esteem and environmental justice.""In an early autumn dominated by news of a mind-boggling $700 billion federal bailout of financial institutions, this effort to use federal power to mandate environmentalist indoctrination throughout the nation's classrooms received little ink or airtime.No Child Left Inside deserves a lot more attention in the context of the larger question of whether Americans should be able to choose the kinds of schools they want for their children or have to accept the standardized, politicized versions mandated by politicians, bureaucrats, and interest groups.Robert Holland (rholland@heartland.org) is senior fellow for education policy with The Heartland Institute.",False,0_accepted,cards

Bearing acres are estimated at 28.0 thousand. California experienced an adequate number of chilling hours, thus benefiting the Freestone crop.

"The sun has both direct and indirect effects on our climate. Solar activity changes on cycles of 11 years and longer. When the sun is more active it is brighter and a little hotter. More important though are the indirect effects. Ultraviolet radiation increases much more than the brightness and causes increased ozone production, which generates heat in the high atmosphere that works its way down, affecting the weather. Also, an active sun diffuses cosmic rays, which play an important role in nucleation of low clouds, resulting in fewer clouds. In all these ways the sun warms the planet more when it is active. An active sun in the 1930s and again near the end of the last century helped produce the observed warming periods.

However, we can suggest, here, that the supposed negative correlation between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures prior to 1920 rests on a misconstrued understanding of the data. As can be seen in Figure 6, the relationship between the change in the warming rate and solar activity is still positive, i.e. the warming rate is peaking near the peaks of solar cycles 10, 12, and 14, but at a much reduced level, indicative of the lower level of solar activity during the period. Indeed, for much of solar cycle 12, and all of solar cycle 14, the warming rate is negative, but the change in the warming rate is still following the level of solar activity, becoming less negative as solar activity increases, and more negative as solar activity decreases. Still, there is a strong suggestion in Figure 6 of a phase shift circa 1920 in which the relationship between solar activity and terrestrial temperatures changes dramatically before and after the shift. Before the shift, the lunar period dominates, and the solar period is much weaker. After the shift, the solar period dominates, and the lunar period becomes subordinate.",True,2_its_not_us,cards

In other words that the warming generated the CO2, rather than vice versa -- as happened in most of the Vostok ice core record from Antarctica. He points out that the rate of increase dropped sharply after Mount Pinatubo in 1991 and rose sharply after the very warm El Nino in 1998.

The extremely low initial numbers were presumably due to a flawed methodology (data collected in the spring in which the capture effort was restricted to shore-fast ice and the floe edge off northeast Baffin Island while recent work has shown that an unknown proportion of the subpopulation is typically offshore during the spring) How can the IUCN confidently conclude that this subpopulation is decreasing? Because the current (2004) estimate based on simulations is that the population is 1,600 bears. The reason for the decline is that the subpopulation appears to be substantially over-harvested. One of the reasons that it is over-harvested is that in 2004 Nunavut increased its hunting quota from 64 to 105 bears per year because reports from Inuit hunters that polar bear numbers in BB had grown substantially.

"""Many would place the beginning of the global warming hoax on the Senate testimony delivered by James Hansen of NASA during the summer of 1988. More than anything else, this exhibition of hyped alarm triggered my active skepticism about the man-made global warming scare. This skepticism was amplified when I acted as reviewer of the first three IPCC reports, in 1990, 1996, and 2001. Increasingly claims were made for which there was no evidence; in some cases the ""evidence' was clearly manufactured. For example, the 1966 report used selective data and doctored graphs. It also featured changes in the text that were made after the scientists had approved it and before it was printed.""",True,5_science_is_unreliable,cards

"British economist Sir Nicholas Stern recently made international headlines with a report claiming the debate is over on climate change and predicting dire economic effects. But on the heels of that report came a scathing article in London's Sunday Telegraph by renowned journalist Christopher Monckton that debunks this so-called scientific consensus. He notes that the United Nation's main report on global warming purposely censored data about a Medieval Warm Period that saw global temperatures 3 degrees Celsius warmer than now. He further states that the famous hockey stick graph, which allegedly shows a major recent spike, has been thoroughly discredited. Apparently, there's little harmony in Britain over this continuing controversy.",True,5_science_is_unreliable,cards
"Climate realists are generally willing to assume, for the sake of argument, that the Earth has warmed somewhat in recent decades. In fact, though, it is not obvious that even this modest claim is true. Satellite data show no net warming for as long as such data have been collected, i.e., back to 1979. Ocean measurements show no net warming over that period, either; the evidence for warming is based on land measurements. But the accuracy of land measurements depends on proper siting and maintenance of weather stations. One obvious factor is the urban heat island effect: many weather stations are located in cities, which grow warmer as more people and buildings accumulate. Thus, increasing temperatures at such stations may be measuring urban development rather than the climate. We all know that the urban heat island effect is realchance of frost in outlying areasyet the data that alarmists rely upon do not take it into account.",True,5_science_is_unreliable,cards
