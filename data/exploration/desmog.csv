Action in one country, focused squarely on one energy source, is not the answer. Sound policy shouldn’t rest on the hope that other nations might follow our climate lead. Unless major emitting countries agree to sacrifice economic growth or energy security to reduce emissions, why should Americans?', 'The global warming threat is the latest science fiction adventure. Senior citizens especially need to be diligent and concerned with the current efforts of politicians and bureaucrats seeking greater regulatory power by scare tactics over so-called global warming. The alarmists are using faulty science to reach untenable conclusions. If we allow the government to enact restrictive measures, whether by law or by a treaty agreed to by the U.S., we will face an energy crisis which will make the energy/oil crisis of the 1970s look like a minor league event.', 'Although global warming alarmists believe carbon dioxide and other man-made greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, they’ve never documented that case with hard science. In fact, CO2 is a vital component in the air we breathe and a life-necessity for every plant and animal on Planet Earth.', 'This is no time for political games. Climate change is not an immediate threat to humanity. Climate-related deaths have declined 98.9% in the last century, and humanity is growing more and more resilient thanks to the availability of affordable, reliable energy. On behalf of all Americans, we urge you to oppose any stimulus proposals that carve out special treatment for or bail out any energy companies and focus instead on stopping COVID-19.', 'These groups collectively are the heart and soul of climate denial,', 'Instead of cutting U.S. energy production and driving up the cost of the domestic energy sources we rely on, we need to put affordable energy first,', 'ccording to 60 Plus, “those who would impede the important work of this Committee and this Nation […] go under the names of groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Friends of The Earth with the help of organizations like MoveOn.org. These feel-good activists, both nationally and internationally, have done a simply marvelous job at swaying public opinion and building walls and roadblocks that stymie the vitality of the energy industry. And by and large, they’ve done it all with smoke and mirrors! Under the guise of something called ‘global warming’ […] his sort of anti-supply bias has to stop for the good of seniors and consumers of all ages.

Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,"['I think it is worth stating that the anthropogenic global warming thesis, at least in its more extreme forms, is both ahistorical and utterly implausible. And I think that needs to be repeated. Ladies and gentlemen, the climate cult will eventually be discredited.', 'Sometimes, when I was feeling particularly bold, I would add things like this: you know, 10,000 years or so back we had an ice age. That was rather dramatic climate change, but presumably that had nothing to do with mankind’s carbon dioxide emissions.', 'I’m pleased to be joining GWPF because it’s consistently injected a note of realism into the climate debate. All of us want to save the only planet we have but this should not be by means which impoverish poorer people in richer countries and hold poorer countries back. Right now, in countries like Australia, the impact of climate policy is to make electricity less affordable and less reliable rather than perceptibly to cool the planet. We need more genuine science and less groupthink in this debate – that’s where the GWPF has been a commendably consistent if lonely voice.', 'I don’t like the climate cult. I don’t like the virus hysteria. I can’t understand the gender fluidity push. I don’t like magic pudding economics and I particularly dislike the cultural self-loathing.', 'Even if reducing emissions really is necessary to save the planet, our effort, however Herculean, is barely-better-than-futile; because Australia’s total annual emissions are exceeded by just the annual increase in\xa0China’s.', 'At least so far, it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm.\xa0Climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than\xa0harm. There’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide – which is a plant food after all – are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be\xa0beneficial.', 'Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes, they do more damage but that’s because there’s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased.', 'I think that climate change is real, humanity makes a contribution. It’s important to take strong and effective action against it, and that is what our direct action policy\xa0does. The important thing is to take strong and effective action to tackle climate change, action that doesn’t damage our economy. And that is why the incentive-based system that we’ve got, the direct action policies, which are quite similar to those that president Obama has put into practice, is – that’s the smart way to deal with this, a big tax is a dumb way to deal with it.', 'So look, this idea that Australians practice cruelty to animals is absolutely nonsensical\xa0and while our rules might still differ in some small respect from Britain’s, our standards would be in all meaningful respects, just as\xa0high… I would be confident in respect of Canada and probably the United States as well, that you could do a deal that focuses on trade without in some way conniving at a reduction in environmental standards or a reduction in labour standards or a reduction in animal welfare standards because we’re talking here about decent, sensible countries with very strong lobbies, quite properly, to protect animals and to protect the environment.', 'While we still seem to be in the grip of a climate cult, the climate cult is going to produce policy outcomes that will cause people to wake up to\xa0themselves.', 'The last thing we should do is drive our industries offshore and be putting pressure on household budgets and risk third world-style blackouts all in the name of climate change. We have got to be sensible and balanced and proportionate about these things and I don’t think other policymakers are right now.', 'Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green\xa0politicians Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide\xa0levels And even if carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring trace gas that’s necessary for life, really is the main climate change villain, Australia’s contribution to mankind’s emissions is scarcely more than 1%.']",,

They celebrated the violence. They named streets after these people engaging in violence. They painted, you know, a lot of the roads to celebrate the folks who were engaging in violence. Hollywood celebrities even donated twenty five million dollars to pay the bail money for the rioters so that they could go out and riot again. So the notion that these people are suddenly outraged by the violence in the Capitol is ridiculous.', 'If the Democrats really wanted to take down Putin’s regime, they would abandon their anti-fossil fuel policies, give up on a “climate change', 'So much for climate change or global warming endangering human lives…but what about the snow and cold weather? Global freezing,\xa0anyone?', 'With the ClimateGate revelations of flimsy ‘science’\xa0behind the man-made global warming theory, the role of the religious left in promoting this fraudulent scheme now deserves serious media scrutiny.', 'In fact, while most observers and experts agree that the climate is changing and may even be warming over the long term, the real debate is over whether human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, are responsible, and whether we can do anything about it. The critics of the theory cast doubt on that connection, noting the lack of definitive evidence of a cause and effect. There are other explanations for possible warming, such as solar\xa0activity.', 'Incredibly, the much-publicized United Nations climate change report, which blames global warming on people, has no published science to back it\xa0up.', 'We were stunned and saddened to hear the news about Wayne Simmons. He has been a colleague of ours on the Citizens’ Commission on Benghazi since we were established in 2013.

Acton Institute,"United States, Italy",https://www.desmog.com/acton-institute/,"['Is it clear that whatever agreement might arise out of the COP 21 meeting is morally obligatory for governments to adhere to and or churches to bless? Church advocacy to this effect would lead us to conclude as much. But it is not at all clear that there is only one morally acceptable path forward for different nations and peoples to undertake with regard to stewardship of the climate. So despite intentions to the contrary, this level of church advocacy only deepens the uncertainty surrounding climate change and responsible Christian stewardship.', '[A]s Butler and Morriss remind us, ‘our Creator also granted us energy stored in coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as embedding it within the bonds of matter, enabling us to meet our needs by responsibly using those sources of energy as\xa0well.', 'hile Bartholomew worries about the possible future harm of global climate change on those in poverty, I am far more concerned with the harm of poverty on the poor today. […]', 'Unfortunately, the public-policy response to global warming proposed by some evangelicals makes actually helping the global poor more difficult. [… To hear a Western (i.e., rich!) evangelical environmentalist tell the poor that they must sacrifice the technologies that would improve the length and quality of life for them and their families in order to achieve a merely speculative benefit they will never see can only make the poor less likely to listen to the gospel that the evangelical brings. Such disillusionment will only deepen when it is realized that those evangelicals continue to enjoy the same lifesaving technologies they are effectively asking the poor to forego.', 'We’ve seen 31,000 scientists just came out who are skeptical of global warming. And they’re worried that the policies people are proposing are actually going to harm the planet and they’re going to make people poorer. We also see some of the effects these regulations can have on the developing countries where serious poverty is a real problem.', 'Global warming, for instance, which remains speculative and based on incomplete computer models rather than on demonstrated science, might cost man and nature a great deal if we rush to impose dramatic limits on fossil-fuel use in a misguided attempt to solve a problem that may not even exist. Just twenty-five years ago, some of the current proponents of global warming were warning us about global cooling.33 Because ecology is still in its infancy, we need to utilize all that we know to help us find prudent solutions for these complex problems. We must also recognize that science alone is insufficient for resolving these matters, especially since these issues have moral implications. Thus, in recognizing that we will have to make unavoidable tradeoffs in striking a balance between human need and a clean environment, we must exercise prudence in addressing environmental concerns.', 'It is probably not surprising that some Catholic environmentalists are less interested in traditional religious matters such as what one believes about God and how one practices the faith than in making sure the birds and fish of the planet were protected from greedy industrialists. In fact, some have a hard time in calling God ‘Father’ because of its patriarchal significance. I got the distinct feeling that environmentalism was at least a large component if not a substitute for their religious faith.', 'It is pretty difficult to believe that there is not an organized effort among Catholic conservatives to rebut in advance whatever Pope Francis might say in his forthcoming encyclical on the environment, what we might call a ‘prebuttal’,', 'We’ve seen 31,000 scientists just came out who are skeptical of global warming.

Climate science is extremely complex for three reasons, according to the climate scientists at our conference—Carl Wunsch (Professor of Oceanography at MIT), David Chapman (Professor of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Utah), William Gray (Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State) and Richard Lindzen (Professor of Meteorology at MIT). First, it is an immature science. The observational records cover a time period that is dwarfed by the relevant geologic time scales. Given the current state of understanding, accurate prediction is not\xa0possible. … [M]odern climate science relies on large, complicated models that seek to describe and predict the climate system, but these models are inherently unreliable and\xa0unstable. … Evidence abounds to suggest that CO2 is far from the most important contributor to global warming. Previous interglacial periods were much warmer and had far lower concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere; and it might eventually be demonstrated that CO2 concentrations lag temperature increases. When the temperature change is within a few tenths of a degree,\xa0it is difficult to identify the particular\xa0causes. … The IPCC’s views on global warming are widely portrayed as representing an objective, scientific consensus, but David Henderson (a former chief economist at the OECD, now at the University of Westminster, U.K.) demonstrated that the IPCC reporting process is flawed and lacks rigor, inclusiveness, and impartiality… . Environmental economist Ross McKitrick (University of Guelph, Ontario) affirmed Henderson’s analysis with an account of his own experience with the IPCC. … The challenge is not, ‘Either we believe in global warming and rescue the planet or we all die.’\xa0It is largely a choice between how much action to take now and how much in the future; and a choice between preventing or adapting to it. The science is still young. Some people take uncertainty as a reason to act, others take it as a reason to proceed slowly.

The earth has many climates, and life has lasted through severe global climate variability. Climate scientists readily agree that the earth has been warming for thousands of years following the peak of the last major glacial age. The warming has not been smooth and may or may not\xa0continue. … Climate scientists also agree that 98 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions have non-human sources (mostly water vapor) and that only some two percent of all greenhouse gases come from human sources. For comparison, the termite and ant family alone digest and compost plants, thereby reportedly releasing carbon dioxide at a rate double that of all human\xa0emissions. … Interestingly, the U.S. surface temperature record for the last 20 years or so shows no statistically significant warming trend, a record that agrees with the balloon and satellite records. Only recently noted is that the widely reported global temperature increase may be attributable in part to sloppy measurement outside of North America and Western\xa0Europe.', 'Global warming is only one of the supposedly human-caused ‘crises’ that are severely questioned by genuine scientists. The latter often are too busy working on genuine problems to take the time to refute the sensational assertions of the ‘activists’\xa0so avidly reported by the media. If the socialist agenda that has become the goal of the so-called environmentalists is advanced, the material costs will be huge and the benefits small. The ultimate cost would be human\xa0freedom. … Nearly everyone believes that the earth is heating up. Is it? Probably not — at least there is no evidence that it is. Why then do so many believe in global warming? Because everybody says\xa0so. … Considering the lack of evidence to support the theory of global warming, coupled with the facts that 1) if global warming\xa0should occur, it is not carbon dioxide that is the important greenhouse gas anyhow, rather it is water vapor. It is water vapor and clouds that would account for 98 percent of the effect, and 2) carbon dioxide is not an air pollutant. It is produced whenever any kind of organic material is burned or oxidized and, more than that, it is absolutely necessary as a nutrient for all green growing plants. The plant world is the only source of oxygen on which all of us depend to stay alive. Carbon dioxide has a positive benefit for green plants — the more of it that is in the atmosphere, the better they like it. If the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should double, and this has been done experimentally by controlling the atmospheres in which plants grow, it results in a 30 percent increase in growth and in harvest yield.

However, measurements of atmospheric temperatures made by instruments lofted in satellites and balloons show that no warming has occurred in the atmosphere in the last 50 years. This is just the period in which human made carbon dioxide has been pouring into the atmosphere and according to the climate studies, the resultant atmospheric warming should be clearly evident he absence of atmospheric warming proves that the warming of the earth’s surface observed in the last 100 years cannot be due to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere caused by human activities.

[…] The fact that smoking in moderation has few, if any, adverse health effects has astounding importance in the tobacco debate.', '8:10] HSB: “You mentioned climate. Let’s get to that. Under your leadership, the Heartland Institute became a leader and has been recognized as such in the realm of climate science, economics, and policy. Why did the Heartland Institute become so deeply involved in this one issue? What did you see that others didn’t about the importance of climate change as an issue, and what impact has Heartland’s efforts had? B: “Well, Heartland started addressing climate actually way back, ah, 1994…1995. We did our first book that had a chapter on climate change in it. We addressed it primarily from an economic perspective, arguing that the cost of reducing emissions was really high compared to the sketchy evidence that we had about the cost of harms and offsetting benefits. Nobody listened to us. We did three, four, or five I thought really good policy studies on this topic looking specifically for example, at a carbon tax on agriculture, and the studies got almost no attention It turns out the reason they got no attention is because people were afraid of catastrophic climate change. When the building is on fire, people don’t argue or negotiate the price of fire extinguishers; they’re all too busy running for the doors, and so we concluded that we had to put the fire out before we can get a reasonable conversation to take place here. We’ve go to address this underlying fear of catastrophic climate change. So we did a deep dive in 2007; we said, where is this fear coming from? Is it based on sound science? Who are the scientists who are in this debate? Do they need our help? Why aren’t they getting a better hearing? And why aren’t Cato, and Heritage, and AEI, and other think tanks engaged in this part of the debate? And what we learned was that virtually none of the free market think tanks were addressing the science. They weren’t doing that because they felt it wasn’t their job. They’re mostly economists and lawyers and they didn’t want to start getting into the physics of climate change. I respect that. But the result was a gap: there was no free market voice on the climate science debate that was taking place, and that was a critical error on the part of free market activists. Unless we address the science, we are going to lose this debate. So we recruited scientists from all around the country. We ended up producing the series called Climate Change Reconsidered for the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change. We had a tremendous impact. I mean, it’s quite remarkable. That book, that series of books, has been cited over 100 times in peer-reviewed articles. The Chinese Academy of Sciences thought so highly of it that it translated it into Chinese and published a condensed volume of Climate Change Reconsidered.', 'We, I think we’re responsible—one of two or three groups that could genuinely claim responsibility for defeating cap and trade and carbon tax proposals at the national level for a ten year period, pretty much from 2007 until today.  think we’re the reason President Trump discovered, or concluded that climate change is not a real problem and not a crisis facing the country, and that by running on that—by defending coal miners for example—he could appeal to a very big base in the United States. People who expected all along that global warming was junk science, that they would rather have good jobs and inexpensive energy than pursue some liberal dream of, you know, replacing all fossil fuel with wind and solar power.', 'So Trump ran on that. He won, and it’s been remarkable: for the last year, he’s been implementing many of the promises that he made as a candidate.', 'Now Donald Trump wasn’t the first choice for most of us. He might not even have been the final choice, but the alternative was truly scary. You know, Hillary Clinton was committed to finishing what Barack Obama started, and that was pretty much destroying the local decentralized education system in America—replacing it with a centralized curriculum. Destroying the decentralized health care system that used to depend primarily on private insurance companies and doctors in private practice. So replacing that with Obamacare, destroying the financial sector I mean all the commanding heights of a free society, President Obama targeted and did major damage for eight years, and for whatever reasons Congress and the courts didn’t seem able to stop him. Hillary Clinton was committed to waging that war for another four years. I’m not sure we could have recovered from that. So we got a second chance at freedom with the election of Donald Trump. Incidentally I decided to step down, now, before the election of Donald Trump, so if anyone is wondering if that influenced my decision it didn’t. But it was a second chance we probably didn’t deserve to preserve freedom in America. It’s very precarious. It is perched on an edge. And so I’m very anxious about the future of freedom,', 'What will Heartland Institute’s role be in that? I am optimistic. I think Heartland is going to grow. There’s a much bigger niche for what we do than what I was able to raise money for to fill. You know, I raised about six million dollars a year for the Heartland Institute. We should be at eight or ten. We should have twenty, twenty five guys working in our, just in our government relations office working with state legislators, giving them the information that they need, testifying when they need testimony, helping them draft legislation. I mean, this is all exciting stuff that they’re asking us to do and we don’t have the staff to do it. o I think under Tim Huelskamp’s leadership we’re going to raise that money. We’re going to expand the staff and fill that niche. So Heartland should be doing well in future years. I only hope and pray that freedom in the United States is going to continue rising while the Heartland Institute is performing its job.', 'The people who still believe in man-made global warming are mostly on the radical fringe of society.

White is an outstanding candidate for this important position. Her past service as a chairman and commissioner of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality gives her the proper experience, and her work before and after that with private-sector groups engaged in environment and energy policy shows a deep familiarity with the issues and trade-offs involved. Best of all, White’s writing and public speaking make it clear she is committed to reversing the intense politicization of science and policy that occurred under President Obama and that started even before then,', 'Though CEQ oversees the NEPA process, it remains unclear how seriously Hartnett-White will take the NEPA review process, for decades seen as a bedrock of U.S. environmental regulation since NEPA became law in 1970,', 'EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s proposal for a Red Team-Blue Team exercise is vague, probably would not be effective, and is unlikely to come about,', 'Although The Heartland Institute has been subject to many attacks from so-called global alarmists, after Joe Bast’s presence was spotted in the Rose Garden an effort was made to harm President Trump by attacking Heartland’s Joe Bast,', 'For the record, The Heartland Institute has contacted nearly all members of the Trump cabinet.

At present, government has the sole power to determine the acceptable level of pollution.

It’s fundamentally an anti-human movement, not a pro-life-of-any- kind movement.', 'You know, one thing I’ve been saying lately is I think it’s just really important that people associate the California blackouts with green energy and the California wildfires with green forestry,', 'lex Epstein: [00:37:10] We’re all taught that climate is bad and getting worse. And yet climate from a human perspective is safer than ever by far. So anyone I have a line that I like to use, which is I don’t trust anyone to predict the future, who can’t predict the present. So if somebody says climate is going to be a disaster in the future and they think climate is a disaster today, they are ignorant or worse. And I think they are worse.\xa0[00:37:35 00:37:48] Because if you have a human perspective on climate livability, you have to admit it’s gotten much better. But if you think that it’s wrong for human beings to have any impact on the climate. And if we have any impact, that means it’s a bad climate, then you think the climate is worse. And that’s the only explanation of climate that the climate catastrophe movement thinking today’s climate is bad because they think it’s bad because they think we’ve changed it some. And so it’s really a religion. It’s really a religion that says that to be good is to not change nature.\xa0\xa0[00:38:18 00:38:19] That’s their standard. That’s their goal is unchanged nature. And my goal is human flourishing. I want humans to live to their highest potential. So if we make the Earth amazing with machine power and it leads to a little warming, which, by the way, is generally desirable for people, and by the way, it also leads to greening of plants.\xa0\xa0[00:38:35 00:38:36] If we change the Earth in that way, along with all the positive ways that our machines change the Earth using fossil fuels, I think that’s a better earth because I care about humans. But if you think it’s bad for human beings to change anything, you’re gonna think it’s what we’ve done is bad. Even though a billion people can live better lives than ever, that’s the only explanation of our whole establishment. Acting like climate is bad and the world is bad is they are antihuman.\xa0\xa0[00:39:02 00:39:19] But once you know the facts about the world, you have to know that there’s something antihuman about the people who are telling you that it’s bad and getting worse.\xa0[00:39:27 00:50:07]\xa0 If you recognize there is no optimal state of the planet, the planet is naturally dynamic. It’s naturally dangerous. It’s naturally deficient. It’s a very imperfect planet. It’s got a lot of potential. But that potential needs to be actualized.\xa0\xa0[00:50:21 00:53:46] Property rights are just so unappreciated in terms of how they enable individuals to coexist in harmony with one another and to have a proper pro human relationship to nature.\xa0\xa0[00:53:58 00:54:13] But we unfortunately have almost and I mean this technically like a fascist system when it comes to the relationship to nature, where basically a government like the EPA or some other entity can just say, you know what, the muskrat on your property. We think that’s important. So you’ve got to leave or you can’t do what you want. And and there’s this real tyranny that happens. I think it’s an anti human view. I think if you care about the muskrat, you go be productive and figure out a way to predict that muskrat yourself, because otherwise people don’t care about the muskrat.\xa0\xa0[00:54:46 00:55:05] And if you just talk to business people in the U.S. about how they say the Endangered Species Act persecutes them, it is unbelievable. Or we had this, um, it was like some waters act in the US that the president, Donald Trump, did a good job of repealing or delimiting. And it was just like if you had a puddle on your property, basically some eco fascist could say, yeah, you know what? That’s a really important puddle. I guess you can’t use it. And that’s that’s not how America became a beautiful place. You know, it became a beautiful place, I think, where there’s more property rights.\xa0\xa0[00:55:38 00:55:46] I think that if we had property rights, we could have a true enjoyment of nature that was actually pro human.\xa0\xa0[00:55:53 00:59:52] I think what’s going on in terms of the climate catastrophism, I don’t think it’s actually really a disagreement about science or certainly any fact. \xa0I think it’s a very deep antihuman orientation.\xa0\xa0[01:00:05 01:00:05] And it’s this idea I keep coming back to the view that changing nature is bad or human impact is is bad. Because if you look at the situation and you think about let’s say you learn two facts about CO2 that at least in that. So it’s a it’s a plant growing gas and it’s a fertilizing gas. You know that. And let’s say in isolation at least it’s a warming gas, at least I. I certainly believe that. So it’s a warming gass. So it has those two attributes. So you might think, let’s say fossil fuels, instead of adding CO2 to the atmosphere, they subtracted CO2 from the atmosphere. So if you just knew, OK, it’s a fertilizing gas and a warming gas and you heard fossil fuels as a side effect or a byproduct, they’re sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere.\xa0\xa0[01:00:49 01:00:50] What would be your reaction? I think you’d be pretty afraid.\xa0\xa0[01:00:54 01:02:18] Leaving aside anything you knew about the details of climate science, if it was taking CO2 out of the atmosphere, you would be worried 01:02:25] But then if you’re oh, it’s just from these basic facts, it’s adding CO2 to the atmosphere. You’d think, oh, well, that’s probably gonna be pretty good for the plants. And we use a lot of plants because we either eat them directly or the animals we eat eat plants. So that’s going to increase our agricultural productivity. And it’s also going to just increase the amount of biomass around the world which is going to mean that all species have more stuff to feed on.\xa0\xa0[01:02:46 01:03:00] So what’s really interesting is that people, before they even hear about the different views on climate science, their expectation is that the world is going to get worse if we add CO2. Why is that? It’s not because of the nature of CO2. It’s because of the religious dogma that impacting nature is bad. It’s impacting nature is viewed as immoral. It’s just wrong for us to impact things and it’s viewed as inevitably self-destructive.\xa0[01:03:26 01:03:59] So it warms place in the coldest places in the world that we want to be more warm. And it warms more at night when we want it to be more warm and it warms more in the winter. So if you learn that the world is becoming a more tropical place, you would think that’s a desirable thing. Most people will like that. The only thing you could possibly be concerned about is is there some way that the warmth is so much or that there’s some trajectory of CO2 that so much that it’s just going to become way warmer than our tropical ancestors had? But then if you look at the nature of it, the effect I mean, if you just look at the history of the planet, CO2 levels used to be fifteen times higher than they are today in Fahrenheit, which I\xa0use emperatures twenty five degrees warmer. And life was incredibly productive at those times, the planet didn’t burn up. So if you know that we have no way, even if we wanted to. Of even getting one third of the way to what CO2 levels used to. Like we have no way of doing that. And then you think so? How could it be that they CO2 could warm things that much? And then you look at how CO2 works in\xa0isolation ou see, it’s what’s called a logarithmic has a logarithmic effect, which is you can think of it as a decelerating effect, which basically means each new molecule of CO2 adds less warmth than the last one. So you keep adding. So somebody uses the analogy of like, you know, you paint a barn and you’re painting it red. And like the first coat of paint is like, you know, you make it. It’s like a little red and then you can make it redder. But after a while, it\xa0stops t doesn’t become much redder because it’s already pretty red. And that’s basically how CO2 works. It’s like every new coat of it or every new amount of it. It warms some, but it warms less than the last. How could a decel… a warming gas with a decelerating affect that has been 15 times higher in the future and life has thrived at twenty five degrees warmer temperature? How could that possibly be a catastrophe for a species that is by far the most adaptable in\xa0history ecause billions of people have machine power that they can thrive in any climate. How could that possibly be a catastrophe? The only way you can think that is if you do not recognize how good human beings make the planet. The planet is naturally dynamic, deficient, dangerous and deficient, and that human productivity using machine power makes it it better. You can only believe this if you have this dogma that the planet is perfect, that any change to it is immoral and disastrous. But that’s a religion that is not science at all. And it is the most irrational, I’m not… any religion…But that is the most irrational religion I have ever heard of.\xa0[01:06:43 01:10:05] Yes. So I just want to sort of situate my own position here. So, I mean, my my main position is that the climate catastrophe movement is a religious and unscientific movement. But what I just want to emphasize that the morality of using fossil fuels, of using more and more fossil fuels going forward, does not depend on them having zero impact on climate. I think it’s very hard to know, certainly if you’re a layman, what’s going on. Because there’s so much distortion and there’s so much of an assumption that, of course, CO2 must have a big impact. After all, it’s on we’re putting an unnatural amount. But even if we are causing significant warming, particularly because, you know, it’s a decelerating function, that is no reason at all to stop using fossil fuels and empowering human rights. So I just want to. Sometimes people get into the climate issue and they act like the case for fossil fuels depends on zero or little impact of fossil fuels on climate.\xa0\xa0[01:11:00 01:11:01] And it it does not because we can use the fossil fuels to make any climate safer as long as we we’re free to use fossil fuels and get machine power. And if we’re not free, then any climate, including the supposedly perfect natural climate, is dangerous and unlivable.\xa0[01:11:17 01:14:43] my view is certainly that the utility of knowing that CO2 levels used to be a lot higher. It has a lot of utility because it it would be different if we had never we were at a threshold of CO2 that had never been exceeded, versus if you know. Oh, it’s been 15 times higher than it was today. And there are other variables that are different. But clearly, it is not something where the planet burns up. The oceans. Nothing like nothing like that happens in general. Life flourishes. The only thing. So the only thing I think you could be legitimately concerned about, but it has to be a pretty small concern in the scheme of things is will warming cause sea level rise that will be inconveniently fast? And I don’t think there’s evidence that it is at all. But you could at least hypothetically be concerned about that with\xa0warming.\xa0[01:15:31 01:17:42]\xa0If they actually cared about protecting people from floods, they would be all for using more fossil fuels so that you could actually produce flood protection like levees and dams.\xa0\xa0[01:17:51 01:27:11] Michael Shellenberger, one of my favorite energy commentators, the author of the new book Apocalypse Never, which is a very valuable book, like he has a good article, says, If solar and wind are so cheap, basically, why is electricity so expensive?\xa0[01:27:23 01:28:30] The idea when people talk about a hundred percent renewable, mostly solar and wind, even for electricity, and they talk about it for all energy, that is a policy that is equal parts ignorant and genocidal. And so that means you, Joe Biden, like you talking about that is like you are basically saying, I want to kill a whole bunch of Americans.\xa0[01:28:51 01:31:40] So we if we want to live, we want billions of people to live and to be empowered with machine power. Then we need more fossil fuels, not less. That’s the moral case for fossil fuels. And fortunately, I’m not. Fortunately, the CO2 is probably a net benefit, but it’s certainly nothing resembling a catastrophe. So that’s that’s even better.\xa0[01:32:02 01:57:21] There’s this idea that if calling the green movement the watermelon movement because it’s green on the outside and red on the inside, red as in communistic. And there’s a lot of truth to that. But if you think about it, the whole idea that we’re destroying the planet is the ultimate pretext for restricting freedom because it basically says anything we do productively is bad.\xa0\xa0[01:57:43 01:57:44] And so the government gets to control us. And to the people who hate achievement or productivity, that checks a box for them because it it it says it’s basically anti-doing anything. And for the people who want control. Wow. What could be a greater thing to control than human impact and for that matter, what could be a greater thing to control than the byproduct of basically, every machine in the world, CO2. Like that is the ultimate control. So it’s it’s it’s very important.\xa0\xa0[01:58:13 01:58:13] It’s an anti freedom movement. And when we say we’re pro fossil fuels, we’re we’re really pro is the freedom to use fossil fuels.\xa0\xa0[01:58:21 01:58:58] So fundamentally, it’s about freedom. And fossil fuels are a product of freedom. And we only want to use them as long as they’re the best choice under freedom. \xa0[01:59:06', 'When we hear that David Koch was a profit-seeking oil refiner we should feel not contempt and blame but admiration and\xa0gratitude.', '…These freeloaders like Bernie Sanders…\xa0There’s a chance that this guy is only alive, or he is alive I should say, because of fracking.

What is causing this extreme crisis that we are heading into right now lex Epstein: [00:02:54] The direct cause is very, very simple, and the only reason why it’s not being globally publicized is that it implicates our establishment. I’m talking about the deeper cause, but the direct cause is very simple. It’s supply and demand, and for the last fifteen-plus years, the world has been involved in a concerted effort to rapidly restrict the supply of fossil fuels, with the explicit goal of rapidly eliminating them by say 2050, and that involves opposing fossil fuel investment, fossil fuel production, fossil fuel refining, fossil fuel transportation, and so that artificially suppressed the supply of fossil fuels. And the promise was that, ‘oh well, all that demand for energy is no problem, because unreliable solar and wind will more than make up the difference.’ And that failed to materialize, and so what you have is a shortfall of supply relative to demand. nd you really saw the height of this irresponsibility in 2020, when we had lockdowns, and, you know, global pandemic, and there was this idea of, ‘oh, we’ll never really need fossil fuels again, and the industry isn’t doing well, and so, we don’t need to invest in them, and it’s okay to talk about divesting,’ and that never made any sense whatsoever. Again we’re talking about the deeper causes, but t’s just very clear that the establishment is involved in a global anti-fossil fuel movement that radically and artificially restricted the supply of this relative to what it should be, and what it would be had they not restricted it, and then that leads to these terrible consequences. [00:04:35 rendan O’Neill: [00:04:56] There is a clear link about the fact that we have essentially been demonizing energy over the past few decades, seeing energy production and energy consumption as problematic things, destructive things, which create so much pollution, so much waste, so much carbon, and the campaigns which is as you say were embraced by the establishment, the campaigns to limit our use of fossil fuels, limit our capacity to produce the energy we need, the idea that that wouldn’t then give rise to some form of energy crisis, or to a spike in energy prices, or problems with supply and demand, it seems to be a complete fantasy.

And I also take the step of, and you could as well, but, ‘I was right about this.’ Like I’ll put out a video and say ‘hey I warned you about this.’ And the reason is, it’s not to aggrandize myself, it’s that, whenever you have a crisis, who’s implicated and who’s vindicated changes the trajectory of the intellectual landscape going forward.

Is it a logarithmic one, which means one that’s decelerating? Is it one that’s accelerating? Because that’s what we’d be really worried about. And then if somebody says that it’s accelerating, it says any of these things, what is their evidence, what actually demonstrated, and what is\xa0speculated And what was interesting in the claims that Micah brought up, every single one of them, I document in the first chapter of the book, The Secret History of Fossil Fuels, every single one of those has been made by many of the same thinkers for 35 years, and has been completely the reverse of the\xa0truth. So the claim is just there’s this dramatic warming, and you hear these predictions and oh, if we use this much coal. But the question is, what’s the track record of that claim and is it speculated or is it demonstrated? I’d say, it’s very much speculated. And the models that are used to make that claim are have been invalidated. They’ve been false over and over. So I don’t think it’s honest.

I mean, well, so first of all, let’s look at the amount of CO2 increase that we’ve had, since the industrial revolution, about 40% more CO2 in the atmosphere. So there hasn’t been very much CO2 out of the atmosphere. And there hasn’t been much cold warning about one degree Celsius, as, as was mentioned\xa0here Since 1896, when when people first figured out this whole logarithmic you know, four watts per square meter per doubling of CO2, we have estimated that it’s about three degrees of global warming for every doubling, but we’re no where near a doubling of CO2 The amount of warming that we’ve had, is quite consistent with the amount of CO2, but it’s not just CO2. What what I was trying to make the case for before is that when you add heat to things they warm up. So we’ve had lots of experience with heat being added, you know, for example, when volcanoes go off and it shapes the earth little bit, it cools off a little bit, and the amount that it cools off matches exactly what we expect, in terms of amount of heat and amount of\xa0cooling If you look back much farther, there were ice ages, you know, long ago, since the last ice age, not not four watts, but about six and a half watts of extra heat. And it’s warmed up about five degrees\xa0Celsius So, you know, Alex proposes not to, we had a 40% increase, he would like to see several hundred percent increase in the CO2 by providing fossil fuels to the whole seven and a half billion of\xa0us nd that would add more heat in in the next hundred years, then all the heat that warmed us about in the last ice age six and a half watts to come out of the Ice Age, say, eight watts to achieve Alex’s vision. So we’re not talking about a small amount of heat, we’re talking about a huge amount of heat being added to the planet. This is not a matter of climate models.

To them, it is an axiomatic truth that carbon dioxide emissions pose a grave threat to the environment, even though the putative causal chain is filled with missing links.

Of course, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that can trap energy. But so is water vapor, and its levels are far harder to track because its amount and distribution are not constant across the earth’s surface. Most crucially, observed cyclical patterns of temperature change do not correlate with slow but steady increases in carbon dioxide. Recent work by climate scientists Richard Lindzen and others shows that during the so-called Holocene period (roughly covering the last 11,000 years), there was a negative correlation between temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations—strongly suggesting that carbon dioxide levels cannot be the main driver of temperature changes.

And it sounds like a very simple inquiry, but it really isn’t, because the basically the carbon dioxide level that can trap heat might be able to some cloud cover, keep it from coming in from the sun. So you increase heat from one source, you reduce heat from another source. It turns out that carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas.

Certainly our rivers are much much better than they were 20, 40 years ago. What annoys me though, is this complete obsession with carbon dioxide almost to the exclusion of everything else, the alarmism that comes with it, based on dodgy predictions and science, and somehow this, ‘If you don’t agree with us that CO2\xa0 is the great evil, you’re against the planet and you’re a denier’.

Well, with a global population of now seven and a half billion compared to two and a half billion when I was born, of course man has an impact.

[00:00:23 ason Funes: [00:00:24] First off, it sounds a little redundant, but these are the type of things that I think are strikingly important that we just remember when we’re talking about oil, gas and coal here in the United States. You know, for all those people who, like, turning the lights on at night or opening their fridge in the morning to get their kids something to eat in the morning, you love fossil fuels. For all those people who enjoy using air conditioning. Cooler homes in the summer, turn on their heat during the winter. Stay warm. You love fossil fuels. For all those people who like to drive their cars instead of walk or for those people who prefer to fly instead of taking a horse and carriage long distance, you love fossil fuels. And for those who take leftovers home in a Styrofoam container from your local restaurant, use plastic straws or drink out of your favorite beverage, except for California, you love fossil fuels. So despite what the anti fossil fuel hypocrites say, the everyday American in this country loves fossil fuels. [00:01:24 ason Funes: [00:01:25] So I want to preface this with saying that the previous administration’s war on fossil fuels was more than just mere hyperbole. At the Department of Interior, we are the second largest revenue generator into the Treasury second only to the Department of Internal Revenue Services. And 2008, the Department of Interior off of royalties on fossil fuels onshore and offshore energy production and hard rock minerals collected 24 billion dollars into the U.S. Treasury in 2008. he last year, the previous administration, that number reduced down to five point nine billion dollars, a significant significant reduction and as Fred mentioned, that the shale revolution and hydraulic fracturing and horizontal, drilling, it couldn’t really stop the federal government from increasing its revenues and production here in the country. But let me give you a dollars and cents description of how we increased revenues at the interior and slowly as a stranglehold of the previous administration’s regulations and the burdensome business practices that the federal government was involved with the private sector just kind of took a stranglehold down on everything. So in 2010 was about nine billion and increased all the way up to 13 billion in 2013 until the federal government realized we need to regulate the heck out of them because we’re anti fossil fuels. The war on fossil fuels was a reality. And then again, it came down all the way to, again, five point five billion dollars in 2016. [00:03:04 ason Funes: [00:03:06] Let me give you paint a picture on offshore royalties. So in 2012, we’re producing generating an income of about eight billion dollars of offshore royalties alone. And 2016, that reduced down to 2.8 billion dollars. Again, a burdensome regulatory agenda that the previous administration imposed on the private sector hindered the energy production here in America and ultimately affected everybody. [00:03:35 ason Funes: [00:04:49] So with that, I do want to tell you some good news about all this. Donald Trump is president of the United States, right? Under President Trump and Secretary Zinke, the literal war on American fossil fuels is now over and becoming energy dominant is a true reality of today [00:05:12 ason Funes: [00:14:08] President Donald Trump is not only a builder, he’s a preservationist and he’s a conservationist. And through oil and gas production here in the United States of America, we’re going to get back to building the bridges, the roads, the facilities that our national parks that all Americans are going to be able to enjoy.

Let’s get to that. Under your leadership, the Heartland Institute became a leader and has been recognized as such in the realm of climate science, economics, and policy. Why did the Heartland Institute become so deeply involved in this one issue? What did you see that others didn’t about the importance of climate change as an issue, and what impact has Heartland’s efforts\xa0had? JB: “Well, Heartland started addressing climate actually way back, ah, 1994…1995. We did our first book that had a chapter on climate change in it. We addressed it primarily from an economic perspective, arguing that the cost of reducing emissions was really high compared to the sketchy evidence that we had about the cost of harms and offsetting benefits. Nobody listened to us. We did three, four, or five I thought really good policy studies on this topic looking specifically for example, at a carbon tax on agriculture, and the studies got almost no\xa0attention It turns out the reason they got no attention is because people were afraid of catastrophic climate change. When the building is on fire, people don’t argue or negotiate the price of fire extinguishers; they’re all too busy running for the doors, and so we concluded that we had to put the fire out before we can get a reasonable conversation to take place here. We’ve got to address this underlying fear of catastrophic climate change. So we did a deep dive in 2007; we said, where is this fear coming from? Is it based on sound science? Who are the scientists who are in this debate? Do they need our help? Why aren’t they getting a better hearing? And why aren’t Cato, and Heritage, and  AEI, and other think tanks engaged in this part of the\xa0debate? And what we learned was that virtually none of the free market think tanks were addressing the science. They weren’t doing that because they felt it wasn’t their job. They’re mostly economists and lawyers and they didn’t want to start getting into the physics of climate change. I respect that. But the result was a gap: there was no free market voice on the climate science debate that was taking place, and that was a critical error on the part of free market activists. Unless we address the science, we are going to lose this\xa0debate. So we recruited scientists from all around the country. We ended up producing the series called Climate Change Reconsidered for the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change. We had a tremendous impact. I mean, it’s quite remarkable. That book, that series of books, has been cited over 100 times in peer-reviewed articles. The Chinese Academy of Sciences thought so highly of it that it translated it into Chinese and published a condensed volume of Climate Change\xa0Reconsidered.', 'We, I think we’re responsible—one of two or three groups that could genuinely claim responsibility for defeating cap and trade and carbon tax proposals at the national level for a ten year period, pretty much from 2007 until\xa0today.  think we’re the reason President Trump discovered, or concluded that climate change is not a real problem and not a crisis facing the country, and that by running on that—by defending coal miners for example—he could appeal to a very big base in the United States. People who expected all along that global warming was junk science, that they would rather have good jobs and inexpensive energy than pursue some liberal dream of, you know, replacing all fossil fuel with wind and solar\xa0power.', 'So Trump ran on that. He won, and it’s been remarkable: for the last year, he’s been implementing many of the promises that he made as a candidate.', 'Now Donald Trump wasn’t the first choice for most of us. He might not even have been the final choice, but the alternative was truly scary. You know, Hillary Clinton was committed to finishing what Barack Obama started, and that was pretty much destroying the local decentralized education system in America—replacing it with a centralized curriculum. Destroying the decentralized health care system that used to depend primarily on private insurance companies and doctors in private practice. So replacing that with Obamacare, destroying the financial\xa0sector I mean all the commanding heights of a free society, President Obama targeted and did major damage for eight years, and for whatever reasons Congress and the courts didn’t seem able to stop him. Hillary Clinton was committed to waging that war for another four years. I’m not sure we could have recovered from that. So we got a second chance at freedom with the election of Donald Trump. Incidentally I decided to step down, now, before the election of Donald Trump, so if anyone is wondering if that influenced my decision it didn’t. But it was a second chance we probably didn’t deserve to preserve freedom in America. It’s very precarious. It is perched on an edge. And so I’m very anxious about the future of freedom,', 'What will Heartland Institute’s role be in that? I am optimistic. I think Heartland is going to grow.

But beyond that, to paraphrase a line from the classic movie The Princess Bride, ‘I do not think “The Science', 'teve Koonin: [00:03:56] What the public sees is that the end of a long game of telephone that starts with that information, but goes through the assessment reports to the summaries for policymakers in those reports and then on to the media and ultimately to the politicians and other people talking to the public. And there’s so many opportunities and motives to distort what the real science says that that’s why the public dialog often reminds me of what you hear in The Princess Bride, where one character says, you know, you keep using that word, but I don’t think it means what you think it means. [00:04:34', 'teve Koonin: [00:10:25] You can do the same sort of thing for record high temperatures in the U.S., which are not increasing over the U.S. as a whole. You can do the same for hurricanes. And that’s one that really surprises people. The official reports say there are no human influence. I’m sorry. The right way to say is that there are no detectable long term trends in almost all hurricane properties. [00:10:51', 'teve Koonin: [00:12:31] On the other hand, as I mentioned in the book and you quoted when you look at the rate at which Greenland is losing ice, it’s highly variable and it was high in the 30s and then it was going and then it was high again, even as the globe was warming steadily. So there’s very likely a large natural variability in the ice sheets. And you’ve got to take that into account as a scientist, if you’re going to say it’s humans that are causing the recent melting. [00:13:07 teve Koonin: [00:13:25] The other thing to say is that if the ice started to melt, all expectations are it would be quite gradual and we would have plenty of time, even according to the IPCC reports. [00:13:39', 'teve Koonin: [00:16:30] The important thing to understand about sea level is not that it’s rising. It’s been doing that for 15000 years. The real question is whether it’s rising more rapidly in recent decades because of human influence as opposed to its natural rate. And the IPCC, while it talks about how the rate in the last few decades is a lot greater than the average in the 20th century and so on, they entirely do not mention, let alone show, a graph showing you that around 1940 it was rising almost as rapidly as it is today, and then it went through a minimum and now is rising rapidly. Again, I would say I fail the student if they did that, because that is not at all an honest presentation of the data and they get away with it. [00:17:23', 'teve Koonin: [00:21:01] So by and large, you see these kind of apocalyptic predictions or statements coming from non-scientists, you know, with the release of the recent U.N. report, Guterres said code red for Humanity. But if you actually read the report, it doesn’t say that at all. And so these are people who are making a gloss on science that they don’t understand in order to again persuade or motivate people. [00:21:31 teve Koonin: [00:21:32] When you read more deeply in the reports, as opposed to people who are trying to interpret the reports, you also discover that you know there’s a lot of fudging going on. […] [00:21:44 teve Koonin: [00:22:13] The world has more than enough food right now, and you can bet that we will be able to adapt just fine as the climate changes slowly. […]The same is true of deaths. People make outrageous projections using extreme emissions scenarios and very sensitive models, and then just report the a little bit in the media. [00:22:42', 'teve Koonin: [00:24:21] I’ll read the quote. “The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and hence cameras to be led to safety by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.', 'teve Koonin: [00:24:49] And you know, politicians need to motivate people and the strongest motivator is fear. Probably the next is greed after that and then may be lost, but the politicians don’t get involved with that last one. And so, you know, it’s natural for the politicians to do that. And climate is such a great motivator because it’s diffuse. It’s out there in the future. And to the extent that it involves energy, it touches just about everything that society does. So how could you resist, right? What disappoints me most are the scientists who know better, who remain silent while the issue is exaggerated and played up for fear.

You see a little bit in the last couple of decades in California, where it has been getting a little bit drier, but over a couple of centuries that’s not unusual.', 'escribing his book, Koonin has claimed: “The impact of human influences on the climate is too uncertain (and very likely too small) compared to the daunting amount of change required to actually achieve the goal of eliminating net global emissions by, say, 2075. For me,', 'This is the equivalent of setting up a committee on nuclear weapons proliferation and having someone lead it who doesn’t think nuclear weapons exist,', 'Koonin mentions that this climate is always changing. This is a standard line in the WSJ because it sounds reasonable at first blush, but of course it conveys a deep falsehood. The fact is that the actual peer-reviewed scientific research shows that (a) the rate of warming over the past century is unprecedented as far back as the 20,000 years paleoclimate scientists are able to extend the record and (b) that warming can ONLY be explained by human\xa0influences Indeed, it is the RATE of warming that presents such risk to human civilization and our environment. There is no doubt that there were geological periods that were warmer than today due to long-term changes in greenhouse gas concentrations driven by natural factors like plate tectonics. But consider the early Cretaceous 100 million years ago when CO2 concentrations were even higher than today, and there were dinosaurs roaming the ice-free poles. Over the last 100 million years, nature slowly buried all of that additional CO2 beneath Earth’s surface in the form of fossil fuels. We are now unburying that carbon a *MILLION* times faster than it was buried, leading to unprecedented rates of increase in greenhouse concentrations and resulting climate changes. To claim that this is just part of a natural cycle is to be either deeply naive or\xa0disingenuous.', 'Of the many points to be made, here are a\xa0few Koonin’s analysis totally fails to consider the significant risk of very serious impacts on marine life of ocean acidification from the rising CO2 concentration. Impacts are already affecting those growing oysters and other shelled organisms in the Pacific Northwest, and coral atolls around the world are at risk over coming decades—and that is pure chemistry totally independent of climate\xa0models Koonin’s point that the climate has changed so much in the past is actually one of the key reasons to be worried about human-induced climate change. Were the past climate stable even as the various natural forcings were changing, then there would be less reason for concern that human-induced forcings could change the climate. But reality is that past natural forcings caused significant changes in the climate—and now human activities are leading to forcings that are comparable to or even larger than natural ones in the past. In addition, the forcings being created will change climate more rapidly than have natural factors, making this unprecedented except for the catastrophic changes that have followed the impacts of large asteroids. Thus, contrary to Koonin’s assertion that past climate change suggests a policy of caution, a more appropriate conclusion would be that insights gained from past climate change should be leading to much more aggressive policy action than is now\xa0underway Yes, there is lots more to be learned, but the basic physics of the climate change issue have been clear since the 1960s when the President’s Science Advisory Council sent their report to President Johnson and Congress in 1965. Except for refrigerants of various types, human activities are adding increasing amounts of carbon dioxide (and other substances) to the atmosphere that are amplifying the natural warming effect of these substances in the atmosphere—it is not that we are not familiar with the substances we are adding to the atmosphere and have dealt with for decades. That these gases will cause warming has been recognized since the mid-19th century and adding more will surely cause more warming. Certainly, there are more questions to be investigated and resolved, and they do affect how best to adapt and other policies—but they do not alter at all the fundamental reality that human activities have become the primary driver of changes in climate, overwhelming the cycling changes in solar radiation and being much longer lasting than the occasional volcanic\xa0eruptions On sea level rise, Koonin’s comments are again mistaken and misleading. The present rate of sea level rise is well above the rate for the first half of the 20th century. The relatively stable climate that has allowed civilization to expand over the last several thousand years has kept sea level quite constant—you can still visit the coast of Sicily and find the remains of salt flats constructed in ancient times. That climate change can cause sea level to change is a key lesson from past changes in the climate that Koonin fails to mention. Since the peak of the last glacial cycle, sea level rose about 20 meters for each one degree Celsius increase in global average temperature (equivalent to a sea level rise of about 30 feet per degree Fahrenheit!!) While it took centuries or more for the full effect to be felt in the past when natural forcings were changing slowly, the adjustment will likely be much more rapid with the faster increase in forcing due to human activities. While the rate of rise will likely decrease slowly with warming because there is less ice on land to be melted, there are still about 75 meters (near 250 feet) of potential sea level rise in the ice tied up in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which have been experiencing accelerated loss of\xa0mass.', 'For example, John Christy showed this figure, A not equal to B, and was asked by one of the physicists in the room, well, why? Why, Professor Christy, what’s going on? How do you explain this divergence in warming rates between the models and the observations? What’s going on there? And John, Christy shrugged his shoulders and said Mother Nature’s going to do what Mother Nature’s going to\xa0do.', 'My comment to the committee when something like that was asked to me a month ago was, ‘Mother Nature has within her all the necessary tools to generate extreme events that exceed what we have seen in the past 50 years.’ So, whatever we have seen out there, Mother Nature already has the ability to do\xa0it.', 'Of course, those isotopic measurements have been made by labs around the world. You know, it’s very, very well established science. But John Christie did not agree. And when Professor Koonin\xa0asked him, well, why don’t you agree? John Christie said, because I did not make the measurements myself. And again, you could sort of see the amazement in in the room, the the import of that statement is that I am not going to trust anyone else, no measurements unless I’ve made them myself.', 'So the red the red team lost, the red team was not convincing to the members of the American Physical Society, Steve Koonin stepped down as chair of this subcommittee charged with updating the statement. And now he’s calling for the same red team blue team process, even though the process that he presided over. Did not yield a result that that he liked, that he was comfortable with.', '[…] [I]n this instance, Dr. Koonin has an extensive history of devoting a part of each year to small-group studies of societally-relevant science. These activities long predate Dr Koonin’s joining BP, and BP allowed him to continue this practice in his individual capacity. BP contributed no funds into this study and had no influence over its content. Moreover, as discussed in the report Prelude, all participants share the belief that the relationship between climate engineering and CO2 policy is so complex and multi-faceted that directionality cannot straightforwardly be assigned between encouragement of climate engineering research and discouragement of CO2 reduction\xa0policies.']",,
Gerrit Cornelis van Kooten,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/gerrit-cornelis-van-kooten/,"['The climate emergency is not an emergency at all. Why? Because the problem is easy to solve. There are two simple solutions if we are only willing to consider them rationally. First, engineers have shown that it is possible to remove CO2 from the atmosphere by direct air capture, and then store it. Initially, the cost will be expensive, but nothing even close to what the coronavirus will cost. Further, while the technology develops, we can wait to see how fast temperatures are rising, and what sorts of damages we might expect Second is an option that would need to be implemented sooner, but would benefit society nonetheless. Working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a group of nuclear engineers at TerraPower has developed a Traveling Wave nuclear Reactor (TWR) that is absolutely safe to use. If significant numbers of TWRs could be built, costs would be competitive with other sources of power generation. Indeed, as my own research (and that of others) has shown, any serious effort to reduce CO2 emissions from the generation of electricity will require a shift toward nuclear energy. If environmentalists oppose nuclear energy, they will have no other way to retain an economic standard of living that is even close to what we enjoy now and, at the same time, reduce CO2 emissions by even half nfortunately, the main obstacle to the avoidance of catastrophes, such as COVID-19, occurs when (1) our focus shifts from immediate, real threats to future questionable ones; and, (2) all current problems are blamed on the questionable future threat. By putting all of our preparedness eggs in the climate-change basket, we are left not only to weather the storms associated with those threats for which we are unprepared. By attributing all our problems to climate change, we also assume there is one single solution to all our problems and that is to stop burning fossil fuels. How naïve have we become?', 'The correlation between CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use and rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 is taken to constitute evidence that human activities are responsible for climate change. However, there is no straightforward causal link between human fossil fuel use and temperatures, although this remains an area of contention,', 'I am more convinced that changes in solar activities (whether sunspots, various types of cycles, etc.) are a better explanation of changing temperatures and possible global warming than CO2.', 'In my view, the only real threat to humanity comes from sea level rise, and it is miniscule. The threats to polar bears, ecosystems, agriculture, etc., are vastly overstated and, in many cases, non-existent. I have yet to see convincing evidence that the threats are going to be catastrophic. From my perspective, I would welcome 5 to 8 degrees of warming, or even more. Warm weather is much better for one’s health than cold weather (as shown in peer-reviewed research),', 'It might come as a surprise to many, but there is no consensus regarding global warming. The science underpinning the view that anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are leading to runaway global warming is unsettled. There never was a consensus. Nor does science operate on the basis of consensus. If anything, the scientific evidence has sharply turned against the idea that catastrophic anthropogenic global warming is underway.', 'Despite what advocates claim, renewable power—including wind and solar—isn’t free and comes with only modest benefits to the environment,', 'Climate change is a contentious policy issue (Tol 2014; Nordhaus 2013).

Indeed, from that perspective, the ultimate question is whether mitigation or adaptation is the better option.

It also appears that an agreement to resolve this incompatibility may be insurmountable However, if the price for a COP26 compromise is the abandonment of the 1.5C goal, the West’s 2050 Net Zero agenda itself would become futile and self-destructive in face of China’s unrestrained expansion of cheap energy and its rise to global dominance. Clearly, all signs point to adaptation as opposed to mitigation as the best and perhaps only means for tackling climate change.', 'To summarize: There is no evidence to suggest that there are more wildfires today than they were in the past.

Cliff Ollier, who got to know Fairbridge extremely well, gives a personal account of their relationship, and Ewan Tyler, who was a student at the University of Western Australia during Fairbridge’s time there, provides us with a student’s view of what he was like,', '[W]hile the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing and a part of the increase is due to human activities, there is a saturation effect – the resulting warming is not linearly proportional to the concentration. A doubling of atmospheric CO2 does not produce twice the warming, again something not understood by the public. In fact I understand the relationship is logarithmic, in which case the additional warming effect with increasing concentration tapers off very quickly,', '. Climate change is a constant. The Vostok Ice Cores show five brief interglacial periods from 415,000 years ago to the present. The Greenland Ice Cores reveal a Minoan Warm Period 1450–1300 BC, a Roman Warm Period 250–0 BC, the Mediaeval Warm Period 800 1100AD, the Little Ice Age and the late 20th Century Warm Period 1900–2010 AD . Carbon dioxide is necessary for all life on earth and increasing atmospheric concentrations are beneficial to plant growth, particularly in arid conditions. Because the radiation properties of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are already saturated, increasing atmospheric concentrations beyond current levels will have no discernible effect on global temperatures . The twentieth century was almost as warm as the centuries of the Mediaeval Warm Period, an era of great achievement in European civilisation. The recent warm period, 1976–2000, appears to have come to an end and astro-physicists who study sunspot behaviour predict that the next 25–50 years could be a cool period similar to the Dalton Minimum of the 1790s-1820s . The evidence linking anthropogenic (man-made) carbon dioxide emissions and current warming is limited to a correlation which holds only for the period 1976 to 2000. Attempts to construct an holistic theory in which atmospheric carbon dioxide controls the radiation balance of the earth, and thus determines average global temperatures, have failed . The anthropogenists claim that the overwhelming majority of scientists are agreed on the anthropogenic carbon dioxide theory of climate control; that the science is settled and the debate is over; and that scientific sceptics are in the pay of the fossil fuel industries and their arguments are thus fatally compromised. These claims are an expression of hope, not of reality . Anthropogenists such as former US Vice President Al Gore blame anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for high temperatures, droughts, melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels and retreating glaciers, and a decline in the polar bear population. They also blame anthropogenic CO2 for blizzards, unseasonable snow, freezing weather generally and for hurricanes, cyclones and other extreme weather events. There is no evidence at all to justify these assertions . Increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide will have negligible impact on the earth’s radiation balance and will promote plant growth everywhere. There is no need to sequester CO2 in the ground or to subsidise nuclear or other non-carbon based methods of energy production . ‘Tropical’ diseases such as malaria and dengue fever are not related to temperature but to poverty, lack of sanitation and the absence of mosquito control practices . The decarbonisation of the world’s economy would, if attempted, cause huge economic dislocation. Any democratic government which seriously sought to fulfil decarbonisation commitments would lose office. Shutting down coal-fired power stations and replacing them with renewable energy sources such as windmills or solar panels will cause unemployment and economic deprivation', 'The Europeans who have championed the Kyoto Protocol and the regime of de-carbonisation which is the essence of the Protocol, together with their supporters in Australia, would have us believe that by reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by an almost imperceptible amount (through the establishment and enforcement of an international treaty), we can influence the world’s climate. This notion is, quite simply, a fantasy,', 'But what is noteworthy is that the role of CO2 as essential plant food and fertiliser is never mentioned by the Kyoto protagonists.

They must develop scientific evidence that the theory has been oversold. The way to do that is to vigorously support programs like NASA’s Earth Observing System and the Air Force-NOAA National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) — a next-generation weather satellite — that can close gaps in our understanding of the climate. There are enough of those gaps today so that truly draconian regulatory regimes can be justified on the basis of what might happen if warming continues.

Is that not extraordinary given that when the previous target was raised from 60% to 80%, in the Government’s estimates the cost more than doubled? Going from 80% to 100% will certainly more than double it\xa0again The Chancellor believes that it will cost a trillion pounds, which could otherwise be spent on welfare programmes, health and education; the UN climate committee believes it will cost at least twice what the Treasury estimates; and the New Zealand Government have estimated that it will cost five times as much relative to their economy, as has been suggested. Given \u200bthat, is it not irrational to enter this, as any, policy programme without first estimating the costs and calculating the benefits?

For the last decade, the world hasn’t heated up as their theories suggest it should have done. Indeed, it has cooled\xa0slightly …] And likewise they’ve altered the data in the past, or they’ve selected data from the past which has wiped out the evidence of the so-called medieval warming period when\xa0the world was probably warmer than it is now, because after all if it was warmer then without us all burning lots of hydrocarbons, it’s suggests\xa0that the hydrocarbons aren’t the only things that cause the temperature and the climate to\xa0change.

They do have that effect, although there is less certainty about how much the complex feedback effects that climate models seek to replicate may amplify the comparatively modest effect of increasing CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. Nonetheless, in my view it is wise to take measures to prevent and to adapt to global warming, and it is sensible to try to assess the costs and benefits of action and inaction to ensure that we adopt the most cost-effective\xa0approach. The simple fact is that, since the beginning of this century, the average global temperature has flatlined; indeed, over the past 18 months it has fallen back, and according to the satellite measurements of temperature, it is now basically back at the level it was in 1979, when such measurements started to be\xa0taken.', 'I hope that we will listen to those scientists, many of whom are in Government employ, who have warned against alarmist views, and that we will take a more consensual view of the basic minimum science that is agreed and open that up to debate and discussion, without trying to silence those who disagree by calling them “deniers', 'Most people would discover that the anti-fracking lobby’s scare stories are as baseless as those of the anti-vaxxers,', 'Despite the scaremongering, more than a million shale wells have been drilled in North America without a single report of a building being destroyed by subsequent micro-seismic tremors,', 'The only hope of overcoming this problem would be for the Government to invite Labour in, to discuss issues such as national security concerns and how to assess local support – and ask shadow ministers to pledge to honour permits awarded before the election, if they win.

That’s why I voted against the resolution today.  I have said it before: manmade climate change is real and it’s a serious threat to our citizens, to our economy, to our environment, to our national security and to our world. This climate problem is a massive one and we must act, but aspirational documents will not solve this crisis –real solutions focused on innovation will.  That’s why I’m concentrating on how our country can produce affordable, reliable, dependable energy 24/7 that will help us meet our emissions reductions goals.\xa0 And I’m working to make sure that we do it in a way that incentivizes nations like China and India to address the global climate crisis as well.\xa0\xa0 The truth is even if we zero out our country’s use of fossil fuels tomorrow, we must face the facts that other nations have invested in and will continue to use fossil fuels to develop their economies for decades to come. We cannot successfully address our climate challenge by eliminating sources of energy that countries are committed to using. Only through innovating and developing new technologies that reduce carbon emissions will we truly make a difference. \xa0 Whether it be successfully commercializing emissions-reducing technologies in the power, manufacturing, or transportation sectors, the U.S. must lead the world in innovation.\xa0 And we must do so in a way that creates meaningful opportunity for those communities here in the U.S. that have already been left behind instead of punishing them with burdensome mandates. I look forward to collaborating with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure we are working towards real world solutions that address the global climate, instead of playing political games with one of the greatest challenges we all are facing.', 'I’m Joe Manchin, I approve this ad because I’ll always defend West Virginia. As your senator, I’ll protect our Second Amendment rights. That’s why the NRA endorsed me. I’ll take on Washington and this administration to get the federal government off of our backs and out of our pockets. I’ll cut federal spending and I’ll repeal the bad parts of Obamacare.

But the coal-state lawmaker said any solutions to the problem ‘must be grounded in reality, which requires a recognition that fossil fuels aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.'"", '00:09:54] Our shared focus on identifying pragmatic solutions to the urgent problem of climate change makes the work of this committee vital to our nation. I believe it sets a model for working together to come to an agreement on a bipartisan path forward in spite of partisan rhetoric. I also want to thank our distinguished panel for joining our committee to share your insights with us today. [00:10:13 [00:10:15] For years I’ve argued and we need to be working from an agreed upon set of facts about the climate crisis in order to move forward quickly with real world solutions that protect our communities and workers from unnecessary economic harm. You really can’t play a game of darts if you can’t agree on what the bullseye is. And that’s what we’re dealing with here. People, I’ve never seen in any one town such as this, people will basically set their opinions and try to try to justify their opinions based on what they want the facts to be, not based on what the facts are and try to work towards an agreed position. [00:10:57 [00:10:58] To that end, we are seeking to use this hearing to identify what emissions reductions the power sector has achieved and what the power sector must do to contribute in near-term and long term emission targets. I believe that the focus must be on the path towards innovative power generation technologies that will keep the lights on, our economies humming and achieve the emission reductions we so desperately need. [00:11:18 [00:11:19] First man made climate change is real and it’s a serious threat to our citizens, to our economy, to our environment and to our national security. In 2016, a devastating flood took the lives of twenty three West Virginians, unparalleled in any other time in history in West Virginia. Over the last four years, I’ve asked the White House for emergency funding six times as a result of severe flooding. My office deploys an emergency response page during severe weather and we have posted it dozens of times over the past few years. [00:11:48 00:11:49] In Alaska, my dear friend and colleague here and Chairwoman Murkowski, there have been four communities who need to immediately pick up and move and 12 more actively planning for a partial or total community relocation due to climate change. As Mr. Schutt will tell you about in his testimony. [00:12:08 00:12:09] Climate impacts have also forced people to leave their communities permanently in the wake of storms like Hurricane Maria, after which nearly 130,000 people left Puerto Rico, according to the Census Bureau. And if you just look on the news today, what happened in the last couple of days as far as horrific tornadoes down in the south and southwest. According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, the U.S. has experienced 44 weather and climate disasters since 2015. The cost has neared 400 billion with a B. 400 billion dollars. [00:12:43 00:12:44] Second, all communities, including those in energy producing states like West Virginia, Alaska, are experiencing the harmful impacts of the climate crisis. These impacts are often felt disproportionately in West Virginia communities which are already suffering from the downturn in coal production, resulting unemployment and negative effects of coal company bankruptcies on retirement and health care benefits. Therefore, the path to a climate solution must offer states like West Virginians opportunities, not additional economic burdens. [00:13:15 [00:13:16] The chairwoman and I share a deep concern for our rural communities and seek to use this committee as a means of identifying and legislating pathways to ensure our constituents have a role in the clean energy future. And third, the solutions must be grounded in reality, which requires a recognition that fossil fuels aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. [00:13:37 [00:13:39] The IEA predicts that up to 51 percent of China’s power could come from fossil fuels in 2040, depending on energy policies that are adopted. That number could be as high as 57 percent for India. This is the real world we’re living in. The role of fossil fuels in the global economy is growing, and the U.S. must lead the world in pursuing the solutions that will allow us to burn fossil fuels in a cleaner, more cost effective and more efficient manner. [00:14:06 [00:14:07] What we were told by Dr. Birol is that the cost of the plants in Asia is about 11 years old for all their fossil fuel. Now 11 years is the average. They’re going to amortize those plants out. They’re going to run until they’re 40 to 50 years of age. That’s just the economic facts. In America we have plants that are much older. It’s much easier for us to convert than it is for Asia. And that’s just the what we’re dealing with today. It does not mean that we should set aside work, increasing efficiency, advancing nuclear storage or renewables such as solar, wind and hydro power. But it does mean that we have to double down innovative solutions for the clean use of fossil energy in the electric, industrial and transportation sectors. And we must do it today. [00:14:50 [00:14:51] Just last week, Dr Birol, the leader of the International Energy Agency, told this committee that the rest of the world, and particularly countries in Asia, will continue to use fossil fuels for decades to come. He stated and I quote, “Last year, global CO2 emissions once again increased and the main driver for that increase came from Asia.', 'Despite many efforts by EPA, state officials have not engaged in a meaningful discussion of sustainable mining practices that will create jobs while protecting the waters that Appalachian communities depend on for drinking, swimming and fishing. Earlier this year, at the request of the state, EPA issued clear guidance that ensures permits are reviewed using the best science available to protect residents from the significant and irreversible damage this practice can have on communities and their water sources.', 'After talking with Secretary Perry this week and after today’s executive order, I am more confident than ever that the Administration is serious about being a partner in helping us develop the Appalachian Storage Hub. Since 2017, I have been working with the Administration and Secretary Perry to make sure they understood the positive economic impact and the potential energy security an Appalachian Storage Hub will bring to West Virginia and the country,']","['March 2019', 'Manchin was one of four Democratic or Independent senators, along with Krysten Synema of Arizona, Doug Jones of Alabama, and Angus King of Maine  who voted against the Green New Deal (GND).

In certain countries, advocates of environmental protection call themselves ecologists. One environmentalist slogan is ‘Support your ecology.; Most dictionaries (and the Natural Resources Defense Council) define ‘ecology’ primarily as a branch of science whose focus is the relationship between organisms and their environment. By this definition, an ecologist is a scientist specializing in the study of such relationships. But the cores of most environmental advocacy organizations do not consist of scientists proficient in that field. The philosophy of most environmentalist groups is, in effect, that members of endangered species deserve protection and that, because there are billions of humans, humanity does not qualify for protection In the United States and in nearly all other democracies, environmental laws are established primarily to protect humans. For example, wildlife-preservation laws serve to maintain gene pools, which are potentially useful to human therapeutics. Although every civilized society has accepted avoidance of unnecessary harm to nonhuman animals as an ethical obligation, no society is willing to compare human lives to the lives of other organisms In the next century, poverty, ignorance, and protecting the environment will be the greatest challenges to the world community. Public education with three foci—literacy, the sciences, and critical thinking—is necessary for the elimination of poverty.

It draws from three contemporary pieces of work: the revamped ‘blue book’ prepared by ACIL on the cost & benefits of smoking, a recent article by Robert Bork defending people’s choice to smoke and the Alan’s analyses in ‘Soaking the Poor’. The article will address the issues from the viewpoint of the economics and morality of individual choice.', 'Climate alarmists latch onto every climate catastrophe as evidence that mankind is destroying the planet. Even the recent NSW bushfires were attributed to previous emissions of carbon dioxide, with dark mutterings that Tony Abbott would exacerbate matters, in spite of the fact that the most recent IPCC report had been forced to acknowledge that there had been no increases in temperatures or extreme events over\xa0the past 10-15 years Even if greenhouse gases were bringing about harmful climate change, there is nothing that Australia can do to mitigate this – 90 per cent of the world emissions are now attributable to nations which will not moderate such activity within their own domestic\xa0economies With the carbon tax to be terminated, attention therefore needs to be turned to repealing the renewable requirements.', 'The actual cost, if the global warming were to take place along the lines foreshadowed, would be quite small. It would be like the amount over 100 years less than half a year’s growth in the world economy and even that has got a lot of things in which you’re gilding the lily and would suggest that even that’s a gross exaggeration. So, you know, this is not there’s no catastrophic outcomes likely to emerge from warming, even if it takes place … The point is, who knows, are the temperatures going to go up, down or sideways? Nobody knows. I mean, there is a theory attached to the increase in carbon dioxide that they would go up somewhat a little bit. That theory is not being sustained by the evidence over the past 18 years. It may well be true, the theory. But then again, if it is true, the answer is that there would be a slight increase anyway. It will only be an increase of over one and a half or two degrees centigrade. And that increase will have a trivial cost to the economies of the world. By trying to combat it, as we found out in Australia with, you know, you talked about energy poverty or we’re seeing industries disappearing because the costs have gotten too high, trying to combat it will have a catastrophic effect on the economy.', '“Even if mankind is causing the earth to warm the carbon tax always relied on vacuous credulity, since its success assumes the rest of the world will follow Australia’s leadership', 'So what is it we know about human induced global warming? The most important emission is carbon dioxide, the atmospheric content of which has varied between 0.15 and 0.3 per cent over the past half million years. It is only harmful to humans or other animals at concentrations of over 10 per cent and life actually evolved when the atmospheric content was about 7 per cent A doubling of carbon dioxide content to about 0.6 per cent is likely over the coming century. Almost all scientists agree that the main direct effect of this is to increase average global temperatures by slightly over 1°C (beyond a doubling of its share, further carbon dioxide increases have a negligible climate effect) Most models estimate that this is compounded by feedbacks bringing 2-4°C temperature increases. But those feedback effects are unproven and their impact may even be negative. This is at the heart of the differences between ‘warmists’ and ‘deniers’ Higher temperatures stemming from carbon dioxide emissions are likely to compound what most scientists speculate is a trend recovery from the cooler climate experienced during the ‘Little Ice Age’ (which ended a century and a half ago) Each summer brings ‘the hottest day ever’ claims for some area. Sometimes we hear ‘the coldest day ever’ claims. And many cite these occurrences and well publicised storms as proof that ‘climate change’ (the new euphemism for ‘global warming’) is taking place. But these extreme weather events turn out to be unexceptional.', 'Institute of Public Affairs economist Alan Moran said Australia would earn massive and steady income by offering to solve the problem of a permanent home for the world’s nuclear waste ‘It poses no threat, there have been no mishaps since 1944, but Australia could provide a permanent solution to other countries’ problems,’ he said.', 'lan Moran also claimed that “the costs to Australia in continuing to force electricity customers to incorporate uncommercial renewable energy within their aggregate supply are considerable.', 'nne Urquhart: “Thanks, Dr Moran, for that opening statement.

[00:03:14 00:07:14] all of these estimates are basically done by economists who just take the science as given, and they more or less accept the costs of the doom laden aspects of scientific notions. Thus most of the the public statements and costs of living harp on about things like dengue fever and another long defeated disease that could only show a resurrection, as Jay Lehr said actually, with DDT could only show a resurrection if we decided that we were going to ban DDT as we have, which is allowed to resurrect malaria. And some of the now discredited cost elements that are associated with the intensification of hurricanes or lower production of food in Africa. And even things like the reduction of the the coastal areas, inundation of coastal areas. Even the IPCC has tended to downplay that so much more recent report . So that the cost benefit, the costs of the global warming, you know, relatively even at the most, the subjects are, it would cost the world plus two or minus two point five percent of GDP. [00:08:29 [00:09:08] So what we’re actually talking about is a cost which, even on doom-laden forecasts, is about 2.5 percent of GDP at most, in the context of world GDP growing many, many times more than that, perhaps 900 percent. So, you know, in that sense, the actual cost of that of global warming, even on the adverse assumptions being made is quite trivial. [00:09:37', '00:20:20] What we can see is that there will not be a new international carbon tax. Absolutely out of the question. The economics has fallen prey to reality, the costs involved. So it’s now time to take the offensive. And I think we’ve got to think in terms of a variation of the the peace dividend that occurred once the Soviet Union was overturned following the Cold War. That waste that was involved in armaments, et cetera, is similar to the way it’s been accompanied by the great climate scare over the past 15 years. [00:20:52', 'lan Moran: [00:06:18] “Now we had a bit of a discussion about reducing carbon dioxide emissions by other forms of fuel and of course, there’s absolutely no question about it: wind and and any other, solar is basically in a dead end, at least any technology we can think of. But nuclear isn’t.', '00:08:05] “This chart, I think, which just happens to be Australia, but other countries are pretty much the same, it really just illustrates the impossibility of meeting the emission reductions by replacing coal with nuclear […] the fact is that electricity is only about 35 percent of the CO2 equivalent emissions. So if you reduce, use it all, we don’t have anything like to the sort of levels we have been talking about to get that world per capita level two and a half tons, which is again is quartering the existing OECD level.']","['August 13, 2021', 'In acolumn for theSpectator, Alan Moran dismissed the findings of the recently-released Sixth Assessment Report on climate science by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):19Alan Moran. “The IPCC buries two millennia of fluctuating temperatures,”Spectator, August 13, 2021.

What is causing this extreme crisis that we are heading into right now lex Epstein: [00:02:54] The direct cause is very, very simple, and the only reason why it’s not being globally publicized is that it implicates our establishment. I’m talking about the deeper cause, but the direct cause is very simple. It’s supply and demand, and for the last fifteen-plus years, the world has been involved in a concerted effort to rapidly restrict the supply of fossil fuels, with the explicit goal of rapidly eliminating them by say 2050, and that involves opposing fossil fuel investment, fossil fuel production, fossil fuel refining, fossil fuel transportation, and so that artificially suppressed the supply of fossil fuels. And the promise was that, ‘oh well, all that demand for energy is no problem, because unreliable solar and wind will more than make up the difference.’ And that failed to materialize, and so what you have is a shortfall of supply relative to demand. nd you really saw the height of this irresponsibility in 2020, when we had lockdowns, and, you know, global pandemic, and there was this idea of, ‘oh, we’ll never really need fossil fuels again, and the industry isn’t doing well, and so, we don’t need to invest in them, and it’s okay to talk about divesting,’ and that never made any sense whatsoever. Again we’re talking about the deeper causes, but t’s just very clear that the establishment is involved in a global anti-fossil fuel movement that radically and artificially restricted the supply of this relative to what it should be, and what it would be had they not restricted it, and then that leads to these terrible consequences. [00:04:35 rendan O’Neill: [00:04:56] There is a clear link about the fact that we have essentially been demonizing energy over the past few decades, seeing energy production and energy consumption as problematic things, destructive things, which create so much pollution, so much waste, so much carbon, and the campaigns which is as you say were embraced by the establishment, the campaigns to limit our use of fossil fuels, limit our capacity to produce the energy we need, the idea that that wouldn’t then give rise to some form of energy crisis, or to a spike in energy prices, or problems with supply and demand, it seems to be a complete fantasy. [00:05:55', 'Climate policies have been blamed in some quarters for contributing to the recent run-up in energy prices, but there is no evidence. In fact, a greater supply of clean energy sources and technologies would have protected consumers and mitigated some of the upward pressure on fuel prices.', 'lex Epstein: [00:10:00] We need to implicate them over and over and over. It’s not enough to just say once or twice, ‘hey, by the way you had a role.’ It’s not enough. This is your fault, and you are denying responsibility. And I also take the step of, and you could as well, but, ‘I was right about this.’ Like I’ll put out a video and say ‘hey I warned you about this.’ And the reason is, it’s not to aggrandize myself, it’s that, whenever you have a crisis, who’s implicated and who’s vindicated changes the trajectory of the intellectual landscape going forward. We need the right people implicated and the right people vindicated. It happens to be that the anti-fossil fuel side needs to be implicated and the pro-human side, like the two of us, needs to be vindicated.', 'lex Epstein: [00:21:32] Net Zero is such an interesting issue to comment on, because nobody can believe how murderous it is. But, even if you are concerned about climate side effects and warming, it doesn’t change the fact that fossil fuels could have huge, unique benefits, that if we lost, would be absolutely catastrophic, or I’d argue, apocalyptic.

And as punishment, Google’s going to take away the few nickels they throw at our web sites? OK, I won. That’s all I care about.

How happy are the Democrats to shift the narrative from Afghanistan to climate change? [00:02:50 aris Dennard: [00:02:52] The Democrats are very excited about the opportunity to take attention away from the failure that is Joe Biden’s leadership in Afghanistan [00:03:01 00:03:30] They would much rather talk about climate change than talk about the series of crises that this Biden-Harris administration has put the American people in for so many, just seven some odd months. [00:03:42 aris Dennard: [00:05:13] The American people do not want to talk about climate change. They want to talk about safety. They want to talk about security. They want to talk about jobs. They want to talk about the economy. They want to talk about doing things that are going to help empower and uplift them and keep their families safe, not climate change. It’s embarrassing. [00:05:27', 'The Governor blames global warming, but you know, a lot of the problems we have or we can fix,', 'on Kessler: [00:01:00] What I read in The Washington Post, even though it was buried, was and there was also a story in New York Times saying the same thing that despite the shut down of economies worldwide, despite the fact that you didn’t see cars on the road anymore or very few, no more rush hour, you don’t see airplanes taking off very diminished schedules. You saw schools and buildings and offices shut down. Despite all that, there was no change in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In fact, there was even a slight increase during the 16 months of the pandemic. And what it means, of course, is that the whole climate agenda is is a farce. [00:01:47', 'arc Morano: [00:00:32] This is absurd, the global average temperature currently is below the 30 year average, so let that sink in. We’re actually cooler than average over the past 30 years in the month of May going into June. So actually anyone claiming that this is some sign of a climate apocalypse is completely absurd. [00:00:49 arc Morano: [00:00:49] The media is out there, Stephanie, hyping these studies, you know, this was climate change made this much more likely. Well, the Obama physicist Steve Koonin said these kind of attribution studies where they use climate models tuned to whatever they want them to say are the equivalent of having a spiritual adviser claim he helped you win the lottery after you won the lottery. So what they do is they look at an event and they say that’s caused by climate change, whether it’s anything of hurricane, flood, tornado, in this case, heat waves. There is no science. This is like seance science, where people sit around and act as though these climate models are telling them something. There is nothing. [00:01:25', 'arc Morano: [00:05:51] What’s fascinating is Bill Gates, the aforementioned is the one that wanted lockdowns extended, but he is not willing to make an ounce of sacrifice in his life. So when these billionaires all get together and, you know, come up with some master plan for the world, it’s just you look at their behavior, they’re not willing to do anything. Keep in mind that climate activists, these billionaires are supporting and funding, want to actually bring COVID lockdowns to climate lockdowns. [00:06:21 arc Morano: [00:07:17] Here’s the question, Stephanie. And it’s a legitimate question, is Joe Biden a Russian asset? Is Joe Biden in collusion with Russia? And here’s what I mean by that. We have John Kerry claiming and Biden claiming that climate change is the greatest national security threat we face in America. I submit to you the opposite. It’s climate policy is the greatest national security threat. [00:07:37', 'teve Milloy: [00:02:00] Trump’s biggest success with EPA came at the hands of these more balanced panels. EPA did not go overboard on air quality regulation, for example. Roll back some of the war on coal regulations because of these more balanced science panels. But now, the first day back in office new chief Michael Regan, he fired all the EPA science advisers, and more than that in the email to them, he said that he was going to reconstitute the board, but they were going to get rid of that anti-corruption rule, as you point out, so that now EPA is going back to where they’re paying researchers to basically rubber stamp the road work at EPA’s policy. [00:02:42 ara McKinney: [00:02:43] Is this how the far left, when it comes to climate alarmists, is this how they’re able to get away with saying, look, the scientists say, because they can point to such as these panels, they don’t tell you the back story about them rubber stamping their own work where they go. Look, the consensus is here, all scientists say X, Y and Z. Is that what we’re seeing from the Biden administration with these changes? [00:03:00 teve Milloy: [00:03:02] Well, yeah. And you know, you’ve got to remember that the Left owns the entire science establishment now. All the universities and businesses and certainly all the regulatory agencies. It kills me when I see conservatives, I see this all the time in the media know they just take for granted something that’s called science without knowing anything more about it or who did it. The Left own science. They own science review. Peer review—It’s not really peer review anymore. It’s pal review. You know, they’re reviewing their work or their colleagues’ work just rubber stamping and getting it out because it’s politically correct. [00:03:36 teve Milloy: [00:03:37] They make literally billions, you know, collectively, billions of dollars from the government doing this is a huge racket. It’s fraud. I have a book called Scare Pollution. I describe this fraud insofar as the Obama administration used it to destroy the coal industry in America. It’s really outrageous. You know, any time you hear the word science now, as we’ve all learned from COVID, you got to be really careful. [00:03:59', 'arc Morano: [00:01:23] we were dominant after President Trump. And what they’re going to do now is completely stifle American energy, which will make us more reliant on rare earth mining from places like China, Russia. And this will be, of course, to fuel electric cars and solar panels and windmills, which are going to require a huge increase in rare earth minerals. So we’re giving up fossil fuel independence for dependance on China, Russia and other countries. It is going to make the United States more likely to engage in so-called endless wars over energy sources. [00:01:55 hristina Bobb: [00:01:55] Climate change seems a little bit nebulous, and it seems like a catch all for, “oh, it’s the most threatening thing to our environment. It’s the most threatening thing to our way of life and for national security.', 'aniel Turner: [00:00:50] One of the problems of the Paris Climate Accord is that it sets up these globalist mandates that America has to follow, where many countries, particularly China and Russia, have ignored to follow these mandates. [00:01:03 tephanie Myers: [00:01:59] Biden also signed an executive order revoking the 2019 permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. We already know there’s been repercussions with job losses and even union officials speaking out against the move, but what are some of the other consequences regarding this decision? [00:02:14 aniel Turner: [00:02:16] Yeah, this is really a tragic decision, and I’ve spoken to numerous pipeline workers. I’ve filmed a couple of them for our website. And if you are one of these 11,000 individuals, these last three weeks have been hard. You don’t have a paycheck. You don’t have health care benefits. So there is this tremendous suffering that he inflicted for no reason other than pure politics on these people [00:02:39 ut like the Paris climate accord, there is a national security implication here. What we were doing for years is bringing oil from Canada, a reliable partner at a very good price, bringing their oil down to Texas for refining. Now, without the Keystone Pipeline, Canada is going to look for alternatives. They’ll probably send it west to their own ports and send it to China for refining, something I mentioned earlier. Or they’ll send it outside on the world market. 00:03:13] And so now America is going to forego this constant stream of a reliable resource. And let’s face it, we need oil. We still use oil. And there’s this notion we’re going to get away from oil in the next 50, 100 years is just unscientific, and it’s quite frankly insulting and laughable. [00:03:34', 'arc Morano: [00:00:33] The gist of what they’re saying is that there is no climate emergency, and they go deeper. They actually and the findings of this film and talking to even I interviewed the former U.N. climate chief. This is not about the climate. The climate scare, in other words, is the latest environmental scare that has the same solutions going back 50 years. [00:00:54 arc Morano: [00:01:02] Yes, we have warmed since the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850, but we actually, you know, it’s actually a question of whether we’ve warmed since the nineteen thirties. The hottest days on record, and we show this in the film, for heat waves, still, the nineteen thirties hold the record for city heat waves across the United States, and we actually quote scientists on this and then show the data and the charts. So it goes through swings. We cooled until the 1970s and remember the coming Ice Age scare we had the 1970s, but we’ve definitely warmed since then. Obviously, people care about the environment. Everyone cares about the environment. The difference here is trying to say that we’re facing an emergency based on carbon dioxide emissions, a trace essential gas, and the atmosphere, is where this has gone off the rails. They’re using that to lobby for the Green New Deal. [00:01:46', 'arc Morano: [00:02:52] Now the Davos World Economic Forum, they’ve come out and called for, based on COVID and climate, a great reset. Not letting a crisis go to waste. And they’re calling for a socialist, great reset against capitalism. This is the words of the founder of the World Economic Forum. So what’s happened here is they’re going to try to morph climate and COVID together, and you’re going to go from a COVID lockdown to a climate lockdown. [00:03:19 00:03:19] And here’s the other thing they’re actually calling now, academics in Australia, for climate change to be added to your death certificate. We are facing the prospect of daily, monthly, annual death tolls of people who died from climate change. They see the fear, the emotional toll of daily death count, so the climate movement is copying that COVID crisis. [00:03:41', 'iz Wheeler: [00:03:08] Pharmaceuticals are produced via petrochemicals. If we didn’t have fossil fuels, how would we get the medication that we need to sustain not only emergency illnesses, but to sustain chronic illnesses? [00:03:22 aniel Turner: [00:03:46] When people like Kamala [Harris] say we’re going to leave oil in the ground while we’re taking away rubber is plastics, drugs, medicines, Tylenol, laundry detergent. I mean, the list goes on and on. I see fossil fuels as a blessing from God, as an abundance that has given us a wonderful life and people who are too aloof, too indifferent or too ignorant have no idea what fossil fuels have done for the good of mankind.

You get about 10 barrels of salt water for every barrel of oil, and they needed a way to dispose of this, and this is only profitable to develop that when oil is at $114 a barrel, or something insane So, they were injecting all this water into a limestone formation, but somehow this limestone formation was causing the faults in the ground to slip a little bit in a way that they hadn’t done before, and they had been using this formation to dispose of waste water for a really long time.

There was they were incentivized to, like, give people certain medications, or were financially incentivized to put people on ventilators, financially incentivized to mark deaths as Covid deaths.

I don’t remember exactly what the charge was And then I criticized Justin Trudeau, and a former staff member of Justin Trudeau, and Jacinda Ardern. I made a joke about her coming. I was going to New Zealand, and the New Zealand leftist press was freaking out, and I made this joke about bringing my alt right trolls to New Zealand, and and then I put in parentheses: ‘or maybe they’re just, you know, ordinary people who are trying to clean up their rooms.’ So apparently that was casting the profession into disgrace And then they submitted one complainant from the U.S. submitted the entire transcript of our last discussion.

And the emergent consequence of that would be the whole planet would clean itself up', '…', 'And I think part of the reason is I’ve been trying to understand the driving ideas underneath this globalist utopian tyranny that seems to be developing from the top down. And I think it’s driven, at least in part, by this religious vision that already described, you know, that you have to construe culture itself, especially industrial culture, as the tyrannical father raping and pillaging everything in its way, which is unbelievably dangerous way to think, too one-sided, and the, the, the idea that you have to impose limits to growth on people in order to have a sustainable planet, and that’s allied with a view that probably stems all the way back to people like Paul Ehrlich in the 1960s who really believe, really believe, truly, that maybe the planet should only have 500 million people on it, or a billion, you know, in relative poverty or 2 billion barely scraping by […].“And so when I look at ideas like that, that first assumption, you know, the planet has too many people on it. It’s like, I don’t like to hear people say that, because when I hear that, I think, okay, buddy, who exactly are you thinking about getting rid of? Oh, well, it’s not like that. It’s like, yeah, it’s like that has to be like. It is absolutely like that. And so, you know, it’s easy to get all paranoid conspiracy theorist about the WEF [World Economic Forum], say, and maybe there’s some utility in that … I’ve already felt that I been at war for the last six months. And I would say it’s war, because what I observed happening in Europe when I was there last was […] it’s pretty damn clear that the globalist utopians are willing to sacrifice the poor for the sake of the planet, you know, and they’re doing that by cranking energy prices up through the roof. And that means that people die … It’s probably nine months ago that we’re putting 350 million people at on the brink of starvation because we’re cranking energy prices up. And so for me, it’s like, that’s 350 million people. That’s three times as many as the communists killed, you know, in their six decades of trying. And if your cure for the planet is well, you know, we got to put 350 million poor people in jeopardy just so that things are hypothetically better in 100 years, I think. Yeah, I don’t think so, buddy. And also, it’s a little bit too convenient for me that your prescriptions to save the planet are in company by this insistence that the only way forward to that is to give you all the power. It’s like there’s a bit of a moral hazard in that, don’t you think? It’s like I’m just saving the planet. Give me all the power. It’s like you want to save the planet. Or do you want the power?

And there’s plenty of, like, physical evidence of this, and it’s called the Younger Dryas impact theory.

A lot of that is agronomy that we’ve gotten better at farming. We’ve gotten better genetic strains of plants, but some of it also is more CO2. Plants love CO2. We put CO2 into greenhouses to get them to grow more. They also love warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons. “And so, for example, I don’t like to cite, you know, this year, etc., but I will in this case, you know, India has seen record grain harvests this year more than any other year. And long term over the world the yields have been going up. Okay. Because it’s getting warmer, we’re getting better at agronomy, and there’s more CO2. ogan: “Is there a point of diminishing returns? Like is there a point where there’s so much CO2 in the atmosphere that then it becomes detrimental?', 'What I think we will do, looking at all the drivers, is we’re going to adapt. That’s going to be the main way in which we will respond to a changing climate. And, you know, adaptation has got a lot of things going for it. It doesn’t matter whether the climate is changing because of human influences or because of natural phenomena. It’s proportional. If the climate changes a lot, we’ll adapt a lot. If climate changes a little, we’ll adapt a little. Adaptation is local, and so it’s much more palatable politically. You’re spending for the here and now and not for something halfway around the world and a couple generations away. And it’s also very effective.“Consider the following that the globe, as I showed you, has warmed about a degree centigrade, two degrees Fahrenheit since 1900. During that time, we’ve seen the greatest improvement in human welfare we’ve ever had. The population in 1900 was 2 billion people. Today, it’s almost eight, so it’s gone up by a factor of four. And we’ve seen spectacular improvement in nutrition, in health, in literacy, etc., etc. Right. To think that another 1 or 1 and a half degrees is going to completely derail that just beggars belief. … ogan: “Now, when you talk about adaptation and you talk about the rise in the global temperature, so if it does rise up a couple degrees, what sort of adaptation will be required, and what areas of the world, or at least of our country, will actually benefit from a warming? Is that is that a real factor?', 'andall Carlson: “I think part of the problem is that what we’ve been looking at here has been kind of pushed off the radar screen, because the whole emphasis for the last couple of decades now is, you know what? Global warming. That, you know, we’re responsible for catastrophic climate change.“What you don’t want to really be talking about too much is that there has been repeated episodes, too many to count, episodes of catastrophic climate change that we had nothing to do with. We were not the perpetrators. We were the victims. … ogan: “But like when people are talking about global warming, there’s many things that they’re concerned with.

If you eliminate all the natural variables until only carbon dioxide is left, and that’s pretty much where we’re still at, because by the time you get into the 2000s and it was becoming apparent that the sun was actually a much more important factor in climate change and had been acknowledged.

Perhaps women don’t feel as compelled to say, ‘I’ll show you.' ordan Peterson: “Yeah, that’s … that is what seems to happen … We have this reflexive idea, and this is very much the case because this is like the core idea among the feminist neo-Marxist types is that if there’s differences in outcome, that’s … that’s proof of prejudice and that support for the idea of the patriarchal tyranny, and that’s like the core axiom of the radical left is the patriarchal tyranny, as far as I’m concerned. That’s God for them, the patriarchal tyranny. It’s like, well, if it turns out that many of these differences in outcome between men and women aren’t a consequence of the patriarchal tyranny, in fact, even get bigger when you reduce the tyrannical aspect of the patriarch and even the patriarchal aspect to it, then it makes that theory not only wrong, but opposite of the truth, which is the worst kind of wrong … Men are more likely to work outside. They’re more likely to work in dangerous businesses. They’re more likely to run full-time businesses rather than part-time businesses.

Competition with men against women is often thought of as cruel. eterson: “Yeah… Well that… Yes, well and … and there’s a certain amount of reason for that, as well, because obviously physical competition is … it’s easy for that to border on cruel. ogan: “This is why we were … we were talking before the show … that instead of calling people ‘men’ and ‘women’ when referring to like … because there’s … there’s this very disturbing, in my opinion, trend of transgender women entering into these competitions now with women who are biologically female, and dominating them, and that, instead of calling people, ‘men’ and ‘women’, let’s dispense with that.', '… eterson: “And you know that the issue with men, I think with young men, and this is one of the things I’ve been trying to address, is that if your fundamental presupposition is that our culture is a patriarchal tyranny, which is an appalling presupposition, along with the idea that the best way of looking at history is that it was the oppression, the continual oppression of women by men, which is also something that I regard as an absolutely reprehensible doctrine.

In fact, nothing.\xa0[00:05:59][12.8 00:11:52] All of which I think raises a really uncomfortable question in the effort to try to save the climate, are we destroying the environment?\xa0[00:11:59][7.3 00:12:19] Poor countries around the world are in the process still of moving away from wood and dung as their primary energies. And for the most part, this is a positive thing. As you stop using wood as your major source of fuel, it allows the forest to grow back and the wildlife to return as you stop burning wood in your home. You don’t. You no longer need to breathe that toxic smoke. And as you go from coal to natural gas and uranium is your main sources of\xa0energy. t holds out the possibility of basically eliminating air pollution altogether. There’s just this problem with nuclear. Well, it’s been pretty popular to move from dirtier to cleaner energy sources, from energy diffuse to energy dense sources. Nuclear is just really unpopular for a bunch of historical reasons. And as a consequence, in the past, I and I think a lot of others have sort of said, well, in order to deal with climate change, we’re just going to need all the different kinds of clean energy that we have. The problem is, is that just turns out not to be true.\xa0[00:13:17][58.7 00:14:07] in places that are using a lot of nuclear or have grids that are mostly nuclear and hydro, going towards solar and wind and other renewables would actually increase carbon emissions. I think a better alternative is just to tell the truth.\xa0[00:14:21][14.6 00:16:46] I think it’s natural that those of us that became very concerned about climate change, such a big environmental issue, would gravitate towards really romantic solutions, like harmonizing human civilization with the natural world using renewable energies. But I think it’s also understandable that as the facts have come in, that many of us have started to question our prior beliefs and change our minds. For me, the question now is now that we know that renewables can’t save the planet. Are we going to keep letting them destroy it?\xa0[00:17:19][32.5', 'ichael Shellenberger: [00:06:00] We I met one of the other co-founders of Breakthrough Institute. Ted Nordhaus\xa0is also my coauthor working to save the last ancient redwoods. [00:06:09][8.9 ichael Shellenberger: [00:06:10] But when it came to climate change, we really started to lose confidence that our colleagues in the environmental community knew what they were doing. And we really didn’t know how bad it was until around 2004 when we started doing interviews with environmental leaders trying to understand what their strategy was on climate change. [00:06:28][18.4 ichael Shellenberger: [00:06:29] And we came to the conclusion that really the problem with the whole environmental approach to climate was this very narrow way of thinking about the environment. And so we wrote an essay called The Death of Environmentalism Cause a lot of international debate. We did a standard into a full-length book in 2007 called Breakthrough. And what’s stayed the same and over that last 10 years is our belief that technological innovation and making cleaner energy sources cheap is the key to dealing with climate change and other environmental problems. What’s changed is that we’ve come to see a different set of technologies as the most important technologies for dealing with environmental problems [00:07:14][44.5 ichael Shellenberger: [00:08:27] Well, so in terms of I mean, since we’ve just been we’ve been peeling the onion, trying to understand both, you know, what we think matters in terms of making a better world and also why it is that environmentalism is the way it is. And so one of the things that struck us very early on, and it obviously strikes a lot of other people, is that environmentalism is just really depressing. Like, you just you listen to it and you feel bad. And there’s reasons for that, because the story it’s telling me is a depressing story. [00:09:01][33.3 ichael Shellenberger: [00:11:15] environmentalism really doesn’t have that much to do with the environment. And if you look at the founding of the environmental movement, one of the most important things about it in the late 60s and early 70s is that it had this idea that there was too many people, people were destroying the world. [00:11:33][18.5 ichael Shellenberger: [00:12:42] Nihilism in some sense is really the motivating concern of environmentalism. And really what nihilism does is it says we need to choke off human energy, human creativity, human ingenuity.\xa0[00:12:50][8.9 ichael Shellenberger: [00:19:20] I think you saw that on the Eco Modernist manifesto. I mean, mostly the people who attacked were the deep greens.\xa0[00:19:26][5.4 ichael Shellenberger: [00:19:28] You know, not the mainstream environmental groups or mainstream environmental leaders or thinkers. And that’s because the deep Greens are actually quite happy to come out and admit that they want this completely radical change in society. They want. You know, degrowth, you know, they want less, they want and they don’t want less economic growth. They want reversal of growth. And they’re much more openly, more honest about their intentions. [00:19:56][27.9 ichael Shellenberger: [00:25:38] I think that that’s sort of the big confusion that people had, is that the environmental movement was really about the\xa0environment. 00:25:47] You know, we had a conservation movement before. There was an environmental movement. It would mostly very wealthy people. But also, you know, activists persuaded the United States government to set aside special places. Environmental movement really was an anti-nuclear movement. [00:26:02][15.5 00:26:22] The environmental has been, you know, had a problem, which is that it was against nuclear energy, which was which everybody knew was the cleanest and greenest source of energy. I mean, everybody knew it.\xa0[00:26:34][11.4 00:26:34] I mean, ever all the entire scientific class tests, scientific and technical class, the journalists I mean, everybody knew you could produce a huge amount of power with very small material inputs, very small amount of waste, no air and water pollution on an on a tiny footprint of land. And so the environment movement had a problem. It had to attack that energy source.\xa0[00:26:58][23.8 00:27:01] And they had to start making up reasons why nuclear was not environmental. And they still do. They emphasized a lot about the waste, but really it didn’t anything to do with the environment. It really was about choking off\xa0the source of the energy that drives human development and modernization civilization.\xa0[00:27:23][21.3 ichael Shellenberger: [00:33:14] The renewables discourse, the anti-nuclear renewables discourse was basically set up, and the agenda was set up, to move to a low energy civilization.\xa0[00:33:23][9.6 ichael Shellenberger: [00:38:58] one of the one of the projects that Breakthrough is looking at is actually trying to get some clarity about what if you if you accelerate the transition from coal to natural gas and you accelerate the transition of everything to nuclear. What do we think that would mean for climate over the next century? What would what do we think that would mean for for climate stabilization over the next century? But, you know, I don’t want to get too. I think sometimes there’s some people on all sides of this who profess, I think, a level of certainty that I don’t think is appropriate, and I think that the quantifications cannot actually just be more and more misleading than they are revealing. [00:39:40][42.2 ichael Shellenberger: [00:45:44] There’s just there’s the nihilistic Malthusian anti energy anti development anti human wing of the environmental movement called the Dark Greens. They’re obviously never going to be with us. But I have a lot of faith that conservationists will continue to see the wisdom of this approach of ecological modernization over this attempt to sort of starve the beast of its energy.\xa0[00:46:08][24.0', 'We offer this statement in the belief that both human prosperity and an ecologically vibrant planet are not only possible, but also inseparable.

Unfortunately, our models of global warming cannot tell us with a high level of confidence how rapid that change will be and how high the temperatures will rise in 50 or 100 years: difference of a single degree of Celsius translate into very different environmental and economic consequences. If we knew what was coming with certainty we could decide which one of the two main courses of action – gradual adaptation or an all-out effort aimed at emission reduction – is the more rational choice. But we do not, and this means that our production and use of energy, and hence our economic and social well-being, will continue to unfold in a world of profound uncertainty. That, too, is one constant that will not change for decades to\xa0come.', 'Global warming will […]\xa0 lengthen the growing seasons and intensify water cycling—that is, the overall amount of precipitation will increase—in many regions. This combination will result in higher plant productivity, a trend that was already evident throughout most of the United States during the latter half of the twentieth century. But what the long-term effect of such changes will be is not clear. Will the additional productivity be promptly negated by higher rates of respiration in a warmer world? Will most of its increment be stored in long-lived tissues, such as trunks and major roots, or tissues with rapid turnover, such as foliage and fine roots? And, most fundamentally, will global warming eventually convert forests from carbon sinks to carbon sources?', '[C]limate change resulting from emissions of CO2 (and from releases of other greenhouse gases) will have an indisputably global effect,', 'Surely, hydraulic fracturing will not invariably poison the air, will not cause spates of local mini-earthquakes, and will not produce flaming faucets in all nearby areas (the three frightening clichés advanced by its opponents) — but the activity, especially if done in thousands of hurried repetitions and sometimes without careful planning, has the potential to be often unpleasant and disruptive, and sometimes outright damaging,', 'Obviously, there will come a time when global oil extraction will reach its peak, but even that point may be of little practical interest as it could be followed by a prolonged, gentle decline or by an extended output plateau at a somewhat lower level than peak production. At the beginning of 2013, there are no signs that the beginning of this new oil era (regardless of its specific course) is imminent, and forecasting its onset remains an exercise in futility. Only one thing is abundantly clear to me: for the past 15 years I have been quite confident that there is no imminent danger of any sharp peak of global oil extraction followed by an inexorable production slide — and early in 2013 that confidence is greatly strengthened by new facts. Is it too much to hope that even some catastrophists and peak-oil cultists will find it impossible to ignore those numbers?', 'Public unease about safety and problems with costs, liability, and permanent storage do not make a flourishing nuclear industry impossible, but they do demonstrate the enormous influence that mistaken public risk perception can have on government policy and reveal the consistently inept bureaucratic handling of the challenge so far,', '[M]ass balances and cost considerations are enormously challenging.

If fuel resources and technical abilities to recover them at affordable price were the only limitations, we could anticipate at least another century or more of coal, oil and gas. Global warming has made the transition to non-carbon energies a matter of some urgency, but we must nevertheless be realistic about the size and speed of such a\xa0shift. A combination of subsidy changes–removing them from fossil fuels, enhancing them for new renewables–mandated production targets and intensified R&D could accelerate the transition to renewables, but it is unlikely to displace all fossil fuels in a few decades, particularly as many low income countries will rely on them for their\xa0development. We should not forget that the environmentally least disruptive action is not to turn to new technical solutions to produce more energy in different ways, but simply to do with less. ‘Less is more’ has never been more desirable than in the case of tackling the rising levels of atmospheric CO2', 'The myth that the future belongs to electric cars is one of the original misconceptions of the modern energy era, dating back to the introduction of the very first passenger\xa0vehicles. ’Flipping the switch’ and going electric will not solve America’s automotive dependence on imported oil, either in the near- or long-term. A far better use of resources would be to focus on the development of more efficient gasoline-powered engines; there is no reason the U.S. fleet should not average 50 mpg rather than today’s average of less than 25\xa0mpg.', 'A new energy myth was created by the country’s most famous Nobel Prize-winner in July 2008 when former Vice President Al Gore claimed that America’s entire thermal electricity generation industry could be replaced by ‘green’\xa0alternatives in a single decade: ‘Today I challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon-free sources within 10 years. This goal is achievable, affordable, and transformative.’\xa0Transformative it would be, but it would certainly not be affordable, and, even if it were, it could never be accomplished in such a short period of\xa0time.', 'While fossil fuels remain the very foundation of modern economic growth, spreading prosperity and a decent quality of life, they are no longer seen in that light. Rather, they are perceived as undesirable, outright dangerous, or even immoral, since their continuing use is thought to pose an unprecedented threat to the survival of modern civilization. Growing fears about rapid global warming caused by emissions of CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels are behind this increasingly stringent judgment, and these fears feed (mostly unrealistic) visions of an accelerated global transition to nonfossil\xa0energies. Coal has always been more polluting in terms of particulate matter and sulfur oxide emissions than other hydrocarbons, and because it also has the highest CO2 emissions per unit of released energy, it is seen as the most undesirable choice. A closer look at coal’s attributes and the history of its use shows that this judgment is unfair and suggests that if the fuel’s conversion were done with the most efficient techniques available today, we would have no reason to view it so negatively. \xa0Crude oil—largely because of the continuing indispensability of refined fuels for the entire transportation sector occupies a more exalted place than coal. Although its considerable environmental impact is a concern, the main worry about oil is that its global extraction may peak in the very near future, and that this peak will not be followed by a prolonged production plateau but, rather, by a steep decline that will bring a multitude of economic and social hardships—in the most extreme versions, the end of modern civilization. That is why the first myth I debunk in this part of the book is the peak \xa0oil\xa0myth.', 'To think that the United States can install in 10 years wind and solar generating capacity equivalent to that of thermal power plants that took nearly 60 years to construct is delusional,', 'I largely agree with the overall conclusion of Pielke et al. that the IPCC assessment is overly optimistic,', 'The speed of transition from a predominantly fossil-fuelled world to conversions of renewable flows is being grossly overestimated: all energy transitions are multigenerational affairs with their complex infrastructural and learning needs.

Moreover, this inherent unpredictability should warn us that, when, God-like, we try to adjust one or two of the factors involved, such as greenhouse gas emissions, our very best intentions may bring about results we neither expect nor want.

Too many of us believe we are making an independent scientific assessment, when, in reality, we have subsumed Hume-scepticism to the demands of faith', 'The sceptic has to distinguish global warming from climate change', 'Climate change has to be broken down into three questions: ‘Is climate changing and in what direction?’ ‘Are humans influencing climate change, and to what degree?’ And: ‘Are humans able to manage climate change predictably by adjusting one or two factors out of the thousands involved?', 'The most fundamental question is: ‘Can humans manipulate climate predictably?’ Or, more scientifically: ‘Will cutting carbon dioxide emissions at the margin produce a linear, predictable change in climate?’ The answer is ‘No’', 'In so complex a coupled, non-linear, chaotic system as climate, not doing something at the margins is as unpredictable as doing something', 'This is the cautious science; the rest is dogma', 'And what ‘better’ climate will Mr Blair produce? Doing something might lead to worse. Moreover, consensus is not science. Consensus would have entrenched eugenics', 'At present, this basic question has been lost in the clamour ‘to do something at all costs’ and to damn those who doubt we can.', 'Climate change is the norm: over the last 60 years we have experienced both cooling and warming phases, and, no doubt, we will again. And, of course, organisms from plants to porpoises will respond, exactly as Mr Simons describes', 'By contrast, ‘global warming’ is a politico-(pseudo)scientific construct, developed since the late 1980s, in which the human emission of greenhouse gases, is unquestioningly taken as the prime driver of a new and dramatic type of climate change that will result in a significant warming during the next 100 years and lead to catastrophe', 'I remain deeply sceptical of global warming. Indeed, the idea that we can manage climate change predictably by adjusting one factor out of the millions involved is, to use Professor David Bellamy’s recent exclamation on the subject, ‘poppycock’.', 'Electric cars are fine in principle, but remember they need to be plugged in so they are still giving off CO2. Their time will come, but it will be years before they are commercial to make and affordable to buy.', 'For more than 200 years, energy has been derived from hydrocarbons,', '‘Green’ dogma on this issue is most glaringly exposed when applied to the energy poor of the developing world. Not only is this energy underclass to forego hydrocarbons in the name of paranoia about climate, they must also reject other major sources of modern energy as well – above all, nuclear power.', 'Drop the predication of energy policy on the notion that we can manage in any predictable manner inexorable and complex climate change. What we need are strong economies that can adapt to climate change, whatever its ultimate direction', 'Drop the Kyoto Protocol and its ‘command-and-control’ economics which have no chance of working in the face of world economic growth, especially in the developing world.', 'All serious scholars remain cautious about the science of climate change, even those who believe some action needs to be taken', '…', '[C]limate change is, always has been, and always will be, the norm. Climate is the ultimate coupled nonlinear chaotic system; we can no more predict the outcome of doing something (emitting gases) than of not doing something (stopping emitting gases). This central truth must be stated without equivocation: control of the emission of human-induced greenhouse gases will not halt climate change.', '00:42:08] The Christian Science Monitor, “Warning, Earth’s climate is changing faster than even experts expect.', '00:42:30] That was the 1970s. And there are many headlines. And what I would like to stress is, it was a stress on consensus, it was faster than expected, the evidence came from the oceans, from polar bears, it’s always polar bears, from the changing seasons and it’s always disaster', '00:43:00] Why do we believe them now? And what is important in this I think is to remember what that first Earth Day claimed. The first Earth Day in America claimed the following, that because of global cooling, the population of America would have collapsed to 22 million by the year 2000. And of the average calorie intake of the average American would be wait for this, 2,400 calories, would good it were. [LAUGHTER', '00:43:29] It’s nonsense and very dangerous. And what we have fundamentally forgotten is simple primary school science. Climate always changes. It is always as Dick said warming or cooling, it’s never stable. And if it were stable it would actually be interesting scientifically because it would be the first time for four and a half billion years. [LAUGHTER] Second, humans have been influencing climate for a million years as hominids, from the first hominid that set fire to the Savanna grasslands in Africa, when particulates and gases started to rise and they changed the reflectivity of the surface of the Earth', '00:44:16] It’s a long relationship. So the debate, is climate changing and are humans affecting climate change is actually nearly irrelevant. The answers are yes and yes, and always will be. What is really crucial in all this is something that none of the scientists or none of the politicians want you really to hear', '00:44:36] Climate is the most complex system we know governed by thousands of factors, I haven’t time to list them. But the point is, it’s like in my country, Glasgow on a Saturday night, chaos. [LAUGHTER] And what we’re trying to do is manage it by dealing with one pub', '00:45:01] One. And it just won’t work, that’s the danger. In such a system, doing something at the margins and not doing something in the margins are equally unpredictable. And the question we should be asking our politicians are, what climate are you actually aiming to produce and when we get there won’t it change anyway', '00:45:19] The crisis is therefore in ourselves and if we are rejecting this and I ask you passionately to do so for the next two more important reasons, our uh, political agenda as Michael hinted is wrong. There are two great crises in the world of which the biggest unquestionably is four billion people in poverty', '00:45:42] And this topic is an ecocondria of our rich selves, London, New York and Washington. It’s about us and about our hypochondria about the world. If you actually have clean water, you have modern energy, you will cope with change whatever it is, hot, wet, cold or dry', '00:45:50] I’m a left wing critic of global warming because the agenda is fundamentally wrong and dangerous. And believe you me, neither Republican nor Democrat will do anything about it, because our second crisis is a crisis of hypocrisy. Now Michael hinted at this, but I come from Europe which has been lecturing the world on this subject', '00:47:13] I’m not going to say anything about Al Gore and his house. [LAUGHTER] But it is a very serious point. Global warming is also dangerous because I am an environmentalist, but what I’m beginning to see is that global warming is setting age-, agendas which are actually damaging for the environment', '00:47:33] Bio fuels in which the energy relationships are very dodgy, but which have a very significant effect certainly in my country on biodiversity. What is more, we’re having wind farms placed for global warming on very, very sensitive peatmoor habitats. Don’t think therefore that if you’re an environmentalist, you have to be attached to this agenda', 'Isn’t it bizarre to think that is humans, you know, when we are filling up our car, turning on our lights, we’re the ones controlling climate? Just look up in the sky at that massive thing the sun.', 'In the UK, it is a media myth that there are only a few scientists who disagree with the view of ‘global warming’ on which the Kyoto Protocol is predicated.', '…', 'This new booklet, compiled by some of the finest climate scientists and economists, undermines this comfortable conceit. Stressing anew the total uncertainty of climate change science, the authors challenge the key antinomy at the heart of Kyoto – namely that climate is one of the most complex systems known, yet we claim we can manage it by trying to control a small set of factors, namely greenhouse gas emissions. The dangers of such a viewpoint for public policy are made abundantly apparent.', 'The most crass, without doubt, is the image of tropical rain forest as ‘the lungs of the world.', 'Equally nonsensical, however, are the direct attempts to blame the cutting and burning of tropical rain forest for the perceived problems of ‘global warming’. Without 200 years of industrial development in the North, the subject of global warming would never even have raised its ugly head. Any attempt to transfer blame to the South is morally outrageous, especially when we remember that, despite human deforestation, there are probably still more trees in the tropics than there were only 16,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age.', 'tott concluded: “The ‘Great Green Anglo-Saxon Hegemonic Myth’ of the ‘tropical rain forest’ has thus been constructed and deconstructed. Yet, it still holds sway over much of the media, on television, on radio, and in the press. It must now be discredited and discarded as quickly as possible.']","['Philip Stott has been critical of the term “climate change denier.” Inresponse to 2003 reporting by theNew Statesman, Stott claimed, “I am nothing of the sort.

Climate change is controlled by millions of interlinked factors, ranging from the swish of a butterfly’s wing, through 11- and 22-year solar magnetic cycles, volcanism, ocean-atmospheric linkages, sunspot activity, shorter duration wobbles of the Earth, to 96,000-year orbital changes and even intermittent meteor impacts. The intrinsic complexity of all these myriad links still totally defeats our climate modellers, many of whom cannot even account for the variation of water vapour, the most important greenhouse gas of all, and this means that climate change remains largely unpredictable. Moreover, this inherent unpredictability should warn us that, when, God-like, we try to adjust one or two of the factors involved, such as greenhouse gas emissions, our very best intentions may bring about results we neither expect nor want. We have no knowledge of how the tiny changes we initiate may interact with all the other ever-changing cycles.”', 'In another essay on the site, titled “Global Warming isn’t Climate Change,” which Stott described as “first published and syndicated by Bridge News, 2000,” he wrote:', '“‘Global warming’ is part of a misguided agenda that seeks stability when change is the norm on this ever-restless Earth. The same agenda is employed against the use of biotechnology, against the genetic modification of crops, against the very things that help humankind to outpace change in population, pests, diseases and, above all, climate — whether hotter, wetter, colder, drier, or a mixture of all four. The idea of ‘global warming’ is potentially dangerous precisely because it gives the false impression that we might be able to halt climate change by fiddling about with just one or two of the millions of factors involved. It is a serious lie. Even if we achieved all the cuts in emissions proposed, the effect would be a temperature change of probably less than 0.07 degrees Celsius, and, because of the millions of other factors, it might not happen anyway.', '“In face of the reality of change, we need a new agenda, not one based on illusory ideas of sustainable development and stability, but rather one on the dynamics of adaptability and flexible development. To quote Charles Darwin: ‘It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.’ Above all, we must shed precautionary principles and seek adventurous and imaginative responses to risk and change.', '“Climate change is thus reality; global warming a dangerous myth. The sooner we recognize this, the safer for us all.”', 'Philip Stott ran the websiteProBIOTECH,which included apetitionandwriting campaignto support “the continued use and development of biotechnology in agriculture.”', '“[A]lthough this should not matter, I must stress that I have no financial links whatsoever with the biotechnology industry and that I pay for this Site entirely from my own resources,” Stott noted on the site.']",

Where do these things shift, becoming, you know, a mob, or racket, or simply something that’s, you know, a totalitarian lie. And there’s sort of, you know, in the philosophy of science, sort of the, you know, one of the ways I think you sort of frame it is that science always thinks of itself as fighting a two-front war against extreme skepticism and extreme dogmatism. Sort of the way it originated in the 17th and 18th centuries. So extreme skepticism, if I say, you know, I don’t believe the audience exists, I don’t can’t trust my senses, you can’t do science. Extreme dogmatism, you know, the Aristotelian notation that the Earth can’t possibly move, that’s probably also bad for science. And of course, in its, you know 18th-century version where the scientists style themselves as deists and rationalists and free thinkers of various types, it was always the fight against dogmatism that was what dominated, and in a very I think paradoxical turn that is still, you know, the way they think of themselves, even though if you sort of say where it’s gotten unbalanced and erred is obviously just become massively on the side of dogmatism. Not enough skepticism at all. And, you know, you see this of course in all the genuflections to science with a capital S. You know, ‘In this household we believe in Science,’ that’s sort of an evidence that you don’t, or just even just the assert… I always think that, you know, when you have to call things science, you know they aren’t, like climate science or political science. We don’t use physical science or chemical science because, you know, you don’t need to push a point that hard And, this sort of, you know, extreme dogmatism, you know, has of course, it’s not even been of a very stable variety like maybe, you know, the Catholic Church and its anti-Aristotelian notions, or its Aristotelian notions on Earth, you know it didn’t shift itself every month or every year on this.

And this sort of dogmatism, these hairpin turns, this sort of epistemic closure, is I think one of the ways that things have just gotten deranged over and over and over again And I want to maybe just go in the COVID example, I want to go through maybe two other ones. One that was sort of the, a very dramatic one, where I think, which is the… sort of incredible collapse of the absurdist postmodern experiment that was called Afghanistan. And, where, you know, if we discuss it in terms of military tactics, or you know, they didn’t defend the Air Force base or stuff like that, we’re missing what went wrong. What went wrong were, you know, 20 years of this sort of extreme epistemic closure of, you couldn’t dissent, you couldn’t really ask questions about what we were doing, and then you ended up in some, you know, bizarre, absurdist place There’s sort of many different, you know, we spent two trillion dollars, you know, there’s this sort of artificial country we created, propped up. There’s all sorts of crazed anecdotes I sort of found in putting the speech together, you know, two of… one of my bizarro… the super bizarro one was some NGO, you can look this up on YouTube, these are not, you know, things from The Onion as far as I can tell. But you can look it up on YouTube, it’s a NGO offering art studies, they’re going to the Duchamp toilet exhibit from 100 years ago where he just puts a toilet in a museum and they’re explaining to people in Afghanistan why this was an important moment in modern art Of course, this gets translated into Pashto, and then, you know, people are sort of not quite sure what they’re doing there, but, and then of course we had you know, we had the last president who got his Ph.D. from Columbia University wrote a book called, ‘Fixing Failed States,’ again this in even more The Onion episode. And then as the Taliban was closing in on Kabul, he held urgent meetings about ‘digitizing’ the Afghan economy But of course, you know, in general it was just this lie that we were building, you know, a liberal democracy that this was, you know, just history was on the side of people. And if we again want to sort of focus on a dissenting individual voice that articulated the alternative in very clear terms, in ways I will also quote, it would have been president Trump. It was articulated maybe at a late date, we can debate whether it could have still been course corrected, but he said that Afghanistan was fundamentally and irreducibly a ‘shithole country.’ And, you know, you know, I would never say this myself. I would never, you know, and there was a reason he was sort of out on a limb in saying that. Most of us wouldn’t say this. It’s not a very nice thing to say. It’s not clear that it’s a very rigorous scientific description. But certainly in a world where that question couldn’t be debated, couldn’t be discussed, is he right? Is this an accurate description of the country? Is the two trillion dollars just sort of throwing good money after bad? That’s the kind of world in which, you know, the whole thing ends in this crazy way. The mob, the individual is right, the mob sort of silenced the argument, and then, you know, it works until at some point it just, you get to this point of crazed total collapse Now I think, you know, there’s sort of a way in which, you know, Afghanistan is sort of this far away country we don’t know much about. There’s a way in which you could think of COVID as sort of, you know, strange questions of health policy, but maybe I will end on one where I think the epistemic closure is even bigger. It’s maybe, it maybe involves, it involves our, you know, perhaps our most sacred institution, our most high-functioning deep state institution, you know, one we can’t ask questions about at all and therefore we should suspect functions worse than almost all the others. And it’s one that I think, you know, to some extent is accessible more and more on this common-sense level, and I’m thinking of sort of the runaway non-transitory inflation that’s happening in this country, and the complete bankruptcy of the Fed. And, you know, it’s sort of, it’s again, we have this sort of epistemic closure in the form of everybody jumping onto MMT [modern monetary theory] theories, or, you know, theories that you can print as much money as you want so there will never be inflation at of course precisely the moment when they’re wrong. Precisely the moment when no dissent is allowed. I’ve sort of, you know, I think one of my sort of incredibly big misses of the last decade, I did some, but not as much as I should have, was not buying enough bitcoin, not buying enough crypto, and you know it’s $60,000 a bitcoin and still not sure that one should aggressively buy it, but surely what it is telling us is that we are at a crisis moment for the Fed. It is a canary in the coal mine. It is, the crypto market is the pure money market and it is telling us that the epistemically closed bubble around fiat money in the US is heading towards some crisis point You know, the Wizard of Oz is always this metaphor on Fed, on central banking, and I’ve sort of thought that maybe we’re close to a Toto moment in the Fed, where the little dog is pulling the curtain aside from, you know, the holy of holies, and you realize that there’s nobody there, nothing’s really going on. And we’ve had sort of these preliminary questions about the nature of the stock trading and things like this, and, you know, without going into the details of that, it’s when you start asking these questions, you know the institution is in trouble, that it is so over its limb, so out on a limb, and so much at a point where something is going to break. And again, the problem, whether it’s Fed, Afghanistan, COVID, is that we’ve, we have this sort of, these machines for generating consensus, uniformity, you know, and not asking dissident questions even though they’re super urgent and as far as I can tell, the hour is late for all of these institutions, and it’s more urgent than ever that we find a way to have some of these dissident voices get heard in all these different contexts And so, you know, there’s sort of a, you can frame the skepticism dogmatism or the, you know, wisdom of crowds vs madness of crowds. We’re on the side of the madness of crowds, we’re on the side of excess dogmatism, you know, there’s sort of a centralization, decentralization, is there too much decentralization? No it’s way too much centralization of, you know, is it too much misinformation, are there too many crazy dissidents? No. It’s too much the Ministry of Truth. And so yes, maybe there is some theoretical debate, but in practice, it is, you know, if there’s, you know, if there’s a misinformation problem, it’s a centralized misinformation problem, and it’s the misinformation coming from the Ministry of Truth, whether that ministry is telling us things about COVID, or about Afghanistan, or that there’s no inflation at all, even, you know, even to the, even going against what everyone says Now, relating this a little bit to the theme of this conference, of the question of nationalism. It strikes me that one of the ways the question of nationalism always gets misperceived is that it is, it is seen as not so much on the side of individuals or classical liberalism or even conservatism, and yet this seems to be very wrong because the place where we have the worst mobs, the most homogenized forms of thinking possible are, in the context of globalization, and if we think of nationalism as a corrective to the sort of, you know, homogenizing, you know, brain-dead one-world state that’s totalitarian and where there’s no dissent, no individualism is allowed, it is the sort of all-important corrective at this point. And I keep thinking that the worst forms of this sort of fake consensus, fake dangerous centralization Ministry of Truth are all the globalist versions. You know, to make this even more self-referential to the attendees here, I’ve… I was sort of reflecting on, you know, the World Economic Forum, the Davos Conference, where, you know, I last went in 2013 and the sort of insight I had there was sort of interesting where you have all these different people, but they represent, you know, companies, or maybe they represent, maybe they’re the heads of states they represent a government, a country, they might represent, you know, in various contexts they represent of course lots of NGOs. But there are no individuals, and there’s virtually nobody who’s simply representing themselves and thinking for themselves, and saying, ‘This is what I believe. This is not… Nobody agrees with me on this, but this is… I’ve just been looking at the facts and the data and thinking about it myself and this is what I’ve concluded. And it’s sort of a picture of a globalist future in which individuals, you know, will not exist, and it will just be some kind of a braindead Borg. And I think the character of this conference will be the exact opposite of that. We have, you know, all sorts of individuals here, I hope they will not agree with one another. I hope that we will have, you know, incredibly, incredibly vigorous debates and that this is the sort of thing that is needed if we’re going to course correct in this country. And, you know, so I don’t know what metaphor you want to use, but it’s sort of the, you know, the Biden administration is sort of like the Titanic in which we have the zombie retreads from, you know, the Clinton and Obama administrations. I mean people like Larry Summers, even Larry Summers is probably too heterodox to be allowed, and we sort of have the zombie retreads that are just busy rearranging the deck chairs, you know, maybe mopping the floors on the deck or something like that. You know, captain’s reading from the teleprompter, just always North, due North, steady as she goes, and, you know, we need some, you know, we need some dissident voices more than ever Let me, maybe, I will just end with sort of a fantasy of mine of what victory would look like, and I don’t think this will happen, and, or it’s a long ways off. But if… You know, I would like us to go back to a country in which we have ticker tape parades for single individuals. We haven’t had such a ticker tape parade in the 21st century, and individuals not just sports stars, not just individuals who might even be American, who might even be doing things that are changing society, asking dangerous questions, inventing things, and my candidate for the first such person we should do a ticker tape parade for, and he or she may well not show up, but we should still do it, my candidate is Satoshi Nakamoto.

And then, you know, and then there could be sort of a debate about this which of course never, never happens, and one then suspects that, you know, the sort of natural suspicion I always have is that if we can’t have a debate about the high-quality, whether the evidence is high quality or not, that tells us the evidence probably wasn’t high-quality and that he’s probably simply, simply right.', '“And of course, more generally raises questions about just this very, very strange way in which, you know, the mob goes against the individual in which, you know, the consensus theories of truth seem to misfire so badly in our society where, you know, when we look back, you know, a year, year and a half later, I think he was more right than wrong on these things as far as I can tell. It’s still complicated. Certainly, there was something deranged about a debate in which you could not have these sorts of, you could not have these sorts of discussions.

And on the other end of the debate I certainly would say to absolutists who say there is absolutely no relationship. And the truth of the matter based on our investigation is it’s somewhere in between limate science is probably one of the most extraordinarily complex areas of scientific study that anyone can undertake. The variables are numerous. Many of the variables are measurable and – and we can replicate models. Many of the variables we cannot measure them. We cannot model them but we know they’re part of the climate system. And so the models are extraordinarily complicated. And therefore how certain do you feel about the competency of the model and its ability to predict the future. And it’s my view that the models have become increasingly more competent because of high speed computing capabilities and just more sophisticated mathematical modelling and more data to inform the model. But at the end of it there are still a range of uncertain outcomes around these models. And every scientist I know agrees there’s a range of uncertainty. And if you read that PCC-detailed report they talk about these ranges of uncertainty.', 'f CO2 there is a difference I think, a range in that model as to what the impact of 600 ppm versus 400 ppm or 300 ppm would be. There are some ranges around those numbers, even, because it’s not clear when we introduce that into the climate model how some of the other elements that we’re not able to model so well may act to, in a different way. It’s – it is clear that there is an impact. […] What’s not clear is our ability to measure with a great degree of accuracy or certainty exactly how large that impact will be. And that’s why most of the impact studies you see have ranges around them.', 'Regardless, no conceivable combination of demand moderation or domestic supply development can realistically close the gap and eliminate Americans’ need for imports.', 'No energy source of sufficient scale to meet global needs comes without consequences.']","['October, 2016', '“At ExxonMobil, we share the view that the risks of climate change are serious and warrant thoughtful action.”54Rex W.

First of all, we’re not giving anything away, and the problem people have when they’re looking at the analysis is that they forget that this is one of many, many regulations that we implemented in the clean air act, so this regulation is directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and that’s exactly what it would do. ou know, it’s true that regulations like this would have a secondary effect of, you know, affecting emissions of other pollutants, but we have ample and abundant regulatory authority to deal with all the pollution that we’re responsible for under the clean air act. And, in this case, the proposed ACE rule would be very effective in dealing with greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and it would complement the broad suite of other very aggressive standards we have in place for other types of pollution. nnouncer: “So which plan would take more pollution out of the atmosphere? The Trump administration’s plan, or the Obama administration’s plan? ehrum: “Probably the ACE rule, without a doubt. The Trump administration plan. Because the Obama administration plan never got implemented. So it was promulgated as a regulation and then immediately stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court in an unprecedented move by the court.

This is an exercise in being as smart as we possibly can and as effective as we possibly can in regulating. What we’re not doing, which is what the Obama administration did, is put a thumb on the scale. They actively tried to put the coal industry out of business. nnouncer: “What’s wrong with that?

But there’s a difference in letting the market decide and let people decide how they want to generate power versus using the federal government power to push people out of business. So we’re not pushing anybody out of business, but we’re not favoring anybody We’re letting the market decide, and when you look at the market as a whole, there’s a big shift. I mean there’s a fundamental change happening as we speak, as we’re watching, in the power sector. What’s happening is American ingenuity has allowed for the production of phenomenal amounts of good, clean, cheap natural gas, and the power industry is responding. And what you’re seeing is a shift out of coal, a shift out of oil, a shift into gas, and a corresponding but lesser shift into renewables nd the overall effect, you know, without the hand of government touching it is you’re seeing a fundamental shift in the power sector. So, you know, that’s what we believe. We believe that we should let the markets operate, and in this case the markets are operating in a way that achieves real efficiencies from an economic standpoint, makes for a lot of cheap power which is great for this country.

The rate of global warming during the past several decades has been about 0.18ºC per decade. There is no evidence that this rate is increasing. If this continues to the end of the 21st century, the temperature increase will be about 1.8ºC. Some fraction of this warming is a result of natural fluctuations in the earth’s climate as well as from other non-greenhouse-related changes (changes in land use, urbanization, industrialization, data quality, etc.); there is evidence that controls on black carbon (soot) pollution could result in less warming. A warming of this magnitude is near the low end of the range of projections issued in 2001 by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Associated with a low-end warming are low-end projections of sea-level rise and other types of environmental changes Fact No. 2. During the past several decades, the earth’s vegetation has responded in an overwhelmingly positive fashion to changes in the earth’s climate. On average the growing season has lengthened (primarily by beginning earlier in the spring) and the total plant biomass has increased by about 10 percent. This remarkable growth enhancement has been due both to the fertilization effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide as well as the beneficial effects of the patterns of climate change across the globe Fact No. 3. During the past several decades, anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide have continued to rise, but the rate of build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has leveled off. That means that the earth’s biosphere has responded by increasing the rate of carbon dioxide uptake. This is evidenced by Fact No. 2—enhanced global plant growth Fact No. 4.

If this continues to the end of the 21st century, the temperature increase will be about 1.8ºC. Some fraction of this warming is a result of natural fluctuations in the earth’s climate as well as from other non-greenhouse-related changes (changes in land use, urbanization, industrialization, data quality, etc.); there is evidence that controls on black carbon (soot) pollution could result in less warming. A warming of this magnitude is near the low end of the range of projections issued in 2001 by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Associated with a low-end warming are low-end projections of sea-level rise and other types of environmental changes.', '“Fact No. 2. During the past several decades, the earth’s vegetation has responded in an overwhelmingly positive fashion to changes in the earth’s climate. On average the growing season has lengthened (primarily by beginning earlier in the spring) and the total plant biomass has increased by about 10 percent. This remarkable growth enhancement has been due both to the fertilization effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide as well as the beneficial effects of the patterns of climate change across the globe.', '“Fact No. 3. During the past several decades, anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide have continued to rise, but the rate of build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has leveled off.

We have we have a system that is generated by different sources, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, and we have natural gas that supplies, our demand for electrical generation, and we also have coal. And the way that we have it set up in priority by mandate is we have to allow those renewable energy sources, wind and solar, at least 20 percent of manufacturing the electrical requirements for the state of Texas. Now, whether that comes, you know, at the same time natural gas does and that’s rarely the occurrence because of wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine. So what happens to people that use natural gas or coal, as you may know, are very reliable sources and generation of electricity. They have to they have to bring those down to to meet that quota of that 20 percent and the renewable energy sources. So you may have months that that happens quite a bit again, because of wind’s not blowing or the sun’s not shining. So it’s not something that people that are in the business of generating electricity can rely on. On how much electricity demand on sale today and how much just going to sell tomorrow. So, as you know, an investor that we would have an interest in putting in a reliable source using coal or natural gas would be discouraged because you can’t really perform what that success would be in the capital required to do that. So what I think when you look at kind of what happened to us last week, that’s that’s one of the reasons that that occurred. … I think we need to lean on legislature a little bit to get to the bottom of exactly what occurred. And I think the answer to that’s going to be that we need to look at how we allow renewable, that access, onto the grid and maybe not not allow that to happen. … They also need to put attention on how can we encourage reliable energy use in our electrical generation if we’re going to stop this? The bottom line, I think, for everyone in Texas to realize is that all of those options are probably going to equate to higher consumer cost for us when it comes to electricity. […] So you ask what industry can do? I think we need to get out and advocate or advocate for our legislatures to really take a hard look at how we’ve structured, who gets priority system and how do we encourage that we get to an aging grid system upgrade and how do we encourage people to come in and generate more electricity, which would be good for our industry, because I think natural gas is the most reliable, abundant source that we have today for that generation.', '3:20:45] “You know, I think that we’re going to have to take a stronger look at who’s allowed priority on our grid system.

You know, in CO2 has evolved as the world has evolved. You know, from the history that I read, you know the dinosaur ages, and you see the vegetation that that I’ve read about in history. CO2 promotes vegetation growth. It’s just it’s part of what we experience. It’s part of being on the Earth. So, you know, I think that there needs to be a lot more study and a lot more research on what is really causing the fluctuation of CO2 increase.
