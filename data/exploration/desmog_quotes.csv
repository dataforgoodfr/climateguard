60 Plus Association,United States,https://www.desmog.com/60-plus-association/,"The bottom line is this: Global warming, by its very nature, requires global action. Action in one country, focused squarely on one energy source, is not the answer. Sound policy shouldn’t rest on the hope that other nations might follow our climate lead. Unless major emitting countries agree to sacrifice economic growth or energy security to reduce emissions, why should Americans?"
60 Plus Association,United States,https://www.desmog.com/60-plus-association/,"The global warming threat is the latest science fiction adventure. Senior citizens especially need to be diligent and concerned with the current efforts of politicians and bureaucrats seeking greater regulatory power by scare tactics over so-called global warming. The alarmists are using faulty science to reach untenable conclusions. If we allow the government to enact restrictive measures, whether by law or by a treaty agreed to by the U.S., we will face an energy crisis which will make the energy/oil crisis of the 1970s look like a minor league event."
60 Plus Association,United States,https://www.desmog.com/60-plus-association/,"Although global warming alarmists believe carbon dioxide and other man-made greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, they’ve never documented that case with hard science. In fact, CO2 is a vital component in the air we breathe and a life-necessity for every plant and animal on Planet Earth."
60 Plus Association,United States,https://www.desmog.com/60-plus-association/,"This is no time for political games. Climate change is not an immediate threat to humanity. Climate-related deaths have declined 98.9% in the last century, and humanity is growing more and more resilient thanks to the availability of affordable, reliable energy. On behalf of all Americans, we urge you to oppose any stimulus proposals that carve out special treatment for or bail out any energy companies and focus instead on stopping COVID-19."

60 Plus Association,United States,https://www.desmog.com/60-plus-association/,"Instead of cutting U.S. energy production and driving up the cost of the domestic energy sources we rely on, we need to put affordable energy first,"

These feel-good activists, both nationally and internationally, have done a simply marvelous job at swaying public opinion and building walls and roadblocks that stymie the vitality of the energy industry. And by and large, they’ve done it all with smoke and mirrors! Under the guise of something called ‘global warming’ […] his sort of anti-supply bias has to stop for the good of seniors and consumers of all ages. This wonderful country of ours has abundant energy wherewithal, much of it renewable, some of it biodegradable."

Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,"I think it is worth stating that the anthropogenic global warming thesis, at least in its more extreme forms, is both ahistorical and utterly implausible. And I think that needs to be repeated. Ladies and gentlemen, the climate cult will eventually be discredited."
Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,"Sometimes, when I was feeling particularly bold, I would add things like this: you know, 10,000 years or so back we had an ice age. That was rather dramatic climate change, but presumably that had nothing to do with mankind’s carbon dioxide emissions."
Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,"I’m pleased to be joining GWPF because it’s consistently injected a note of realism into the climate debate. All of us want to save the only planet we have but this should not be by means which impoverish poorer people in richer countries and hold poorer countries back. Right now, in countries like Australia, the impact of climate policy is to make electricity less affordable and less reliable rather than perceptibly to cool the planet. We need more genuine science and less groupthink in this debate – that’s where the GWPF has been a commendably consistent if lonely voice."
Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,I don’t like the climate cult. I don’t like the virus hysteria. I can’t understand the gender fluidity push. I don’t like magic pudding economics and I particularly dislike the cultural self-loathing.
Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,"Even if reducing emissions really is necessary to save the planet, our effort, however Herculean, is barely-better-than-futile; because Australia’s total annual emissions are exceeded by just the annual increase in China’s."
Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,"At least so far, it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm. Climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm. There’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide – which is a plant food after all – are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial."
Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,"Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes, they do more damage but that’s because there’s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased."
Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,"I think that climate change is real, humanity makes a contribution. It’s important to take strong and effective action against it, and that is what our direct action policy does. The important thing is to take strong and effective action to tackle climate change, action that doesn’t damage our economy. And that is why the incentive-based system that we’ve got, the direct action policies, which are quite similar to those that president Obama has put into practice, is – that’s the smart way to deal with this, a big tax is a dumb way to deal with it."
Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,"So look, this idea that Australians practice cruelty to animals is absolutely nonsensical and while our rules might still differ in some small respect from Britain’s, our standards would be in all meaningful respects, just as high… I would be confident in respect of Canada and probably the United States as well, that you could do a deal that focuses on trade without in some way conniving at a reduction in environmental standards or a reduction in labour standards or a reduction in animal welfare standards because we’re talking here about decent, sensible countries with very strong lobbies, quite properly, to protect animals and to protect the environment."
Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,"While we still seem to be in the grip of a climate cult, the climate cult is going to produce policy outcomes that will cause people to wake up to themselves."
Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,The last thing we should do is drive our industries offshore and be putting pressure on household budgets and risk third world-style blackouts all in the name of climate change. We have got to be sensible and balanced and proportionate about these things and I don’t think other policymakers are right now.
Tony Abbott,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/tony-abbott/,"Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels And even if carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring trace gas that’s necessary for life, really is the main climate change villain, Australia’s contribution to mankind’s emissions is scarcely more than 1%."

Accuracy in Media,United States,https://www.desmog.com/accuracy-media/,"With the ClimateGate revelations of flimsy ‘science’ behind the man-made global warming theory, the role of the religious left in promoting this fraudulent scheme now deserves serious media scrutiny."
Accuracy in Media,United States,https://www.desmog.com/accuracy-media/,"In fact, while most observers and experts agree that the climate is changing and may even be warming over the long term, the real debate is over whether human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, are responsible, and whether we can do anything about it. The critics of the theory cast doubt on that connection, noting the lack of definitive evidence of a cause and effect. There are other explanations for possible warming, such as solar activity."
Accuracy in Media,United States,https://www.desmog.com/accuracy-media/,"Incredibly, the much-publicized United Nations climate change report, which blames global warming on people, has no published science to back it up."

Acton Institute,"United States, Italy",https://www.desmog.com/acton-institute/,"Is it clear that whatever agreement might arise out of the COP 21 meeting is morally obligatory for governments to adhere to and or churches to bless? Church advocacy to this effect would lead us to conclude as much. But it is not at all clear that there is only one morally acceptable path forward for different nations and peoples to undertake with regard to stewardship of the climate. So despite intentions to the contrary, this level of church advocacy only deepens the uncertainty surrounding climate change and responsible Christian stewardship."
Acton Institute,"United States, Italy",https://www.desmog.com/acton-institute/,"[A]s Butler and Morriss remind us, ‘our Creator also granted us energy stored in coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as embedding it within the bonds of matter, enabling us to meet our needs by responsibly using those sources of energy as well."
Acton Institute,"United States, Italy",https://www.desmog.com/acton-institute/,"hile Bartholomew worries about the possible future harm of global climate change on those in poverty, I am far more concerned with the harm of poverty on the poor today. […]"
Acton Institute,"United States, Italy",https://www.desmog.com/acton-institute/,"Unfortunately, the public-policy response to global warming proposed by some evangelicals makes actually helping the global poor more difficult. [… To hear a Western (i.e., rich!) evangelical environmentalist tell the poor that they must sacrifice the technologies that would improve the length and quality of life for them and their families in order to achieve a merely speculative benefit they will never see can only make the poor less likely to listen to the gospel that the evangelical brings. Such disillusionment will only deepen when it is realized that those evangelicals continue to enjoy the same lifesaving technologies they are effectively asking the poor to forego."
Acton Institute,"United States, Italy",https://www.desmog.com/acton-institute/,"We’ve seen 31,000 scientists just came out who are skeptical of global warming. And they’re worried that the policies people are proposing are actually going to harm the planet and they’re going to make people poorer. We also see some of the effects these regulations can have on the developing countries where serious poverty is a real problem."
Acton Institute,"United States, Italy",https://www.desmog.com/acton-institute/,"Global warming, for instance, which remains speculative and based on incomplete computer models rather than on demonstrated science, might cost man and nature a great deal if we rush to impose dramatic limits on fossil-fuel use in a misguided attempt to solve a problem that may not even exist. Just twenty-five years ago, some of the current proponents of global warming were warning us about global cooling.33 Because ecology is still in its infancy, we need to utilize all that we know to help us find prudent solutions for these complex problems. We must also recognize that science alone is insufficient for resolving these matters, especially since these issues have moral implications. Thus, in recognizing that we will have to make unavoidable tradeoffs in striking a balance between human need and a clean environment, we must exercise prudence in addressing environmental concerns."
Acton Institute,"United States, Italy",https://www.desmog.com/acton-institute/,"It is probably not surprising that some Catholic environmentalists are less interested in traditional religious matters such as what one believes about God and how one practices the faith than in making sure the birds and fish of the planet were protected from greedy industrialists. In fact, some have a hard time in calling God ‘Father’ because of its patriarchal significance. I got the distinct feeling that environmentalism was at least a large component if not a substitute for their religious faith."
Acton Institute,"United States, Italy",https://www.desmog.com/acton-institute/,"It is pretty difficult to believe that there is not an organized effort among Catholic conservatives to rebut in advance whatever Pope Francis might say in his forthcoming encyclical on the environment, what we might call a ‘prebuttal’,"

Adam Smith Institute,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/adam-smith-institute/,"Anything beyond a mild warming is predicated upon the idea of ever more fossil fuel use. If that’s not true because of what we’ve already done then anything beyond a mild warming is not true either,"

Global cooling and global warming are natural cycles all over the earth history spanning 4600 million years. Man or no man it happened due to so many natural processes and each time lasted long enough first two events created a snow ball earth around 2300 and 700 million years back erceptions about climate change often are hotly debated by politicians and generalizations preferred over science. Contrary to misunderstanding in vogue, we are in an overall ice house age currently which started just about 2.54 million years back ven in the small global warming span of about 18000 years when the average Earth temperature has gone up around 6 degrees Celsius and sea levels inspite of going up about 100 metres are lowest ever in the earth history. The sea levels have been much higher during prolonged spells of global warming in Precambrian, Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The Meghalian span could prove our biggest undoing if we keep on dumping our wetlands, oceans and atmosphere with rubbish uring these last 18000 years man saw a long ice age in beginning and then three periods of warming much before he cut out half the natural heritage of forest cover after the industrial revolution. The hotly debated alarm is actually about a currently ongoing mini global warming between two periods of glaciation one gone and one to follow. With solar flares expected to diminish shortly, an extra but very brief mini ice age within this warming is expected too he much hyped role of man accelerating the current global warming is not such a gospel truth as it is made out in passionate climate meets very often by the haves pressing the have nots.

Arun Ahluwalia,India,https://www.desmog.com/arun-ahluwalia/,Man indeed may be a pygmy before nature and incapable of causing or reversing a global warming or climate change. To err on the side of caution let us presume man may be contributing a minor fraction towards warming of the earth. The planet has a great resilience we must not however forget.
Arun Ahluwalia,India,https://www.desmog.com/arun-ahluwalia/,The IPCC has actually become a closed circuit; it doesn’t listen to others. It doesn’t have open minds… I am really amazed that the Nobel Peace Prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists.
Syun-Ichi Akasofu,United States,https://www.desmog.com/syun-ichi-akasofu/,"… climate change during the last few hundred years may be interpreted mainly in terms of a combination of the recovery effect and the multi-decadal oscillation. These are natural changes. Thus, there is a possibility that only a small fraction of the warming between 1900 and 2000 may be attributable to the greenhouse effect. In this view, the predicted temperature change in 2100 is about 0.5°C ± 0.2°C."

Here’s something just put this in your brain. CO2 levels right now are running at about 420 parts per million, which is the lowest they’ve been running for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. And plant life, animal life, human life, millennia, many millennia ago was thriving when CO2 levels were ten times what they are now.

The potential health impacts of climate change include increased prevalence of infectious disease such as Dengue fever and West Nile virus, more heat-related stress and illness, and higher levels of ozone smog (EPA, 2001; IPCC, 2001).

American Institute for Economic Research,United States,https://www.desmog.com/american-institute-economic-research/,"What Do We Know About the Science of Climate Change? Climate science is extremely complex for three reasons, according to the climate scientists at our conference—Carl Wunsch (Professor of Oceanography at MIT), David Chapman (Professor of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Utah), William Gray (Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State) and Richard Lindzen (Professor of Meteorology at MIT). First, it is an immature science. The observational records cover a time period that is dwarfed by the relevant geologic time scales. Given the current state of understanding, accurate prediction is not possible. … [M]odern climate science relies on large, complicated models that seek to describe and predict the climate system, but these models are inherently unreliable and unstable. … Evidence abounds to suggest that CO2 is far from the most important contributor to global warming. Previous interglacial periods were much warmer and had far lower concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere; and it might eventually be demonstrated that CO2 concentrations lag temperature increases. When the temperature change is within a few tenths of a degree, it is difficult to identify the particular causes. … The IPCC’s views on global warming are widely portrayed as representing an objective, scientific consensus, but David Henderson (a former chief economist at the OECD, now at the University of Westminster, U.K.) demonstrated that the IPCC reporting process is flawed and lacks rigor, inclusiveness, and impartiality… . Environmental economist Ross McKitrick (University of Guelph, Ontario) affirmed Henderson’s analysis with an account of his own experience with the IPCC. … The challenge is not, ‘Either we believe in global warming and rescue the planet or we all die.’ It is largely a choice between how much action to take now and how much in the future; and a choice between preventing or adapting to it. The science is still young. Some people take uncertainty as a reason to act, others take it as a reason to proceed slowly. Future generations will have the benefit of greater scientific knowledge, better technology, and greater wealth… . . The range of views expressed at our conference suggests that the debate is far from being over, and that there is still time for much-needed rational discussion."
American Institute for Economic Research,United States,https://www.desmog.com/american-institute-economic-research/,"Climate is a word for regional weather variability. The earth has many climates, and life has lasted through severe global climate variability. Climate scientists readily agree that the earth has been warming for thousands of years following the peak of the last major glacial age. The warming has not been smooth and may or may not continue. … Climate scientists also agree that 98 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions have non-human sources (mostly water vapor) and that only some two percent of all greenhouse gases come from human sources. For comparison, the termite and ant family alone digest and compost plants, thereby reportedly releasing carbon dioxide at a rate double that of all human emissions. … Interestingly, the U.S. surface temperature record for the last 20 years or so shows no statistically significant warming trend, a record that agrees with the balloon and satellite records. Only recently noted is that the widely reported global temperature increase may be attributable in part to sloppy measurement outside of North America and Western Europe."
American Institute for Economic Research,United States,https://www.desmog.com/american-institute-economic-research/,"Global warming is only one of the supposedly human-caused ‘crises’ that are severely questioned by genuine scientists. The latter often are too busy working on genuine problems to take the time to refute the sensational assertions of the ‘activists’ so avidly reported by the media. If the socialist agenda that has become the goal of the so-called environmentalists is advanced, the material costs will be huge and the benefits small. The ultimate cost would be human freedom. … Nearly everyone believes that the earth is heating up. Is it? Probably not — at least there is no evidence that it is. Why then do so many believe in global warming? Because everybody says so. … Considering the lack of evidence to support the theory of global warming, coupled with the facts that 1) if global warming should occur, it is not carbon dioxide that is the important greenhouse gas anyhow, rather it is water vapor. It is water vapor and clouds that would account for 98 percent of the effect, and 2) carbon dioxide is not an air pollutant. It is produced whenever any kind of organic material is burned or oxidized and, more than that, it is absolutely necessary as a nutrient for all green growing plants. The plant world is the only source of oxygen on which all of us depend to stay alive. Carbon dioxide has a positive benefit for green plants — the more of it that is in the atmosphere, the better they like it. If the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should double, and this has been done experimentally by controlling the atmospheres in which plants grow, it results in a 30 percent increase in growth and in harvest yield.

The scientific evidence clearly indicates that this is not the case ll climate studies agree that if the one-degree global warming was produced by an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the additional CO2 first warms the atmosphere, and the warmed atmosphere, in turn, warms the earth’s surface. However, measurements of atmospheric temperatures made by instruments lofted in satellites and balloons show that no warming has occurred in the atmosphere in the last 50 years. This is just the period in which human made carbon dioxide has been pouring into the atmosphere and according to the climate studies, the resultant atmospheric warming should be clearly evident he absence of atmospheric warming proves that the warming of the earth’s surface observed in the last 100 years cannot be due to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere caused by human activities.

The earth is warming, the level of co2 is going up (because of humans), and these things are linked. True, true and true. But recently I’ve been researching the science and the consequences of these facts aren’t as clear as the global warming fear-mongers would have you believe At the heart of the global warming scare is the often repeated message that a doubling of co2 will lead to a temperature increase of 3 (+/- 1.5) degrees. This is possible. It is also possible that a doubling of co2 (from pre-industrial levels) will lead to a temperature increase of 0.4 degrees. Given that temperatures increased 0.6 degrees in the 20th century that implies no further warming … Further, even if there is some moderate global warming, it is not clear that there will be any significant cost. There is little evidence for catastrophic consequences. Environmental economist Robert Mendelsohn explains that moderate warming will benefit countries in the polar regions and the mid-latitudes while only harming countries in the tropical and sub-tropical regions. He suggests that there will only be a net cost if temperatures increase more than 2.5 degrees when mid-latitude countries start to suffer costs."

In his 2007 classic, Cool It, Bjorn Lomborg made the same point: He asked: ‘Why [has] the debate over climate change stifled rational dialogue and killed meaningful dissent?

Lawson Bader,United States,https://www.desmog.com/lawson-bader/,"Earth’s temperature naturally warms and cools cyclically throughout time, and warmer periods are typically more conducive to human thriving than colder periods. While human addition of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), to the atmosphere may slightly raise atmospheric temperatures, observational studies indicate that the climate system responds more in ways that suppress than in ways that amplify CO2’s effect on temperature, implying a relatively small and benign rather than large and dangerous warming effect. Rising atmospheric CO2 benefits all life on Earth by improving plant growth and crop yields, making food more abundant and affordable, helping the poor most of all. Abundant, affordable, reliable energy, most of it now and in the foreseeable future provided by burning fossil fuels, which are the primary source of CO2 emissions, is indispensable to lifting and keeping people out of poverty. Mandatory reductions in CO2 emissions, pursued to prevent dangerous global warming, would have little or no discernible impact on global temperatures, but would greatly increase the price of energy and therefore of everything else. Such policies would put more people at greater risk than the warming they are intended to prevent, because they would slow, stop, or even reverse the economic growth that enables people to adapt to all climates. They would also harm the poor more than the wealthy, and would harm them more than the small amount of warming they might prevent."

Ronald Bailey,United States,https://www.desmog.com/ronald-bailey/,"And on the climate change issue, just a little anecdote, when I first heard about this was when I was working at Forbes Magazine, and somebody was saying, well, they’re claiming that we’re going to warm up the climate, and it’s going to get up to about nine degrees warmer. And I turned to the person and I said, you mean that we’ll be able to have palm trees growing down Fifth Avenue in New York now? And I didn’t see this was a particular problem."
Ronald Bailey,United States,https://www.desmog.com/ronald-bailey/,"Government agencies, from worldwide to regional organizations, have been developed to deal with the policy concerns raised by the greenhouse issue. Many of these government groups have expanded in recent years, and their fate is tied to the perception that global warming represents a significant threat to the planet. Bureaucratic inertia virtually guarantees that the greenhouse question will remain high on the list of environmental policy priorities. Despite the evidence reviewed in this chapter, the upcoming versions of the various IPCC reports will continue to trumpet the threat of global warming. Press releases will probably emphasize the risks of the greenhouse effect while remaining silent about the potential benefits of the greenhouse world."
Ronald Bailey,United States,https://www.desmog.com/ronald-bailey/,"So if we don’t want to perpetuate poverty in the name of preventing climate change, geoengineering may be our way out. Why? Because geoengineering would provide more time for the world’s economy to grow while inventors and entrepreneurs develop and deploy new carbon neutral energy sources to replace fossil fuels … It seems unlikely that fast-growing poor countries like India and China will agree cut back on their use of fossil fuels any time soon. If that’s the case, then emissions reductions in rich countries would have almost no effect on future temperature trends. Geoengineering could give humanity more time to resolve this collective action problem, too."

The third text, Silent Spring, I read while in secondary school. These books profoundly disheartened me and many of my generation because they painted the near future—our future—in hopelessly bleak terms hese gloomy books sold in the millions, and they have dramatically skewed public policy for the past two and a half decades, slowing economic growth and unnecessarily increasing human misery. Even now a new generation of doomsters is flooding our schools and universities with more dire predictions of imminent global disaster. For example, neo-Malthusian Lester Brown’s annual State of the World is used in more than five hundred college courses, and our primary and secondary schools are being flooded with Environmentalist propaganda n this book I hold those environmental alarmists strictly accountable for their faulty analyses, their wildly inaccurate predictions, and their heedless politicization of science, in the hope that the next generation will not grow up feeling that their future is dismal and blighted. This book demonstrates the reality of human progress, and I hope it will thereby help restore the next generation’s belief in the future."

We can always do better, and will, but we should not stop doing what is working  The briefing revealed that Heartland, CEI, Cato, Heritage, and other groups have done a poor job communicating their STRATEGIES to people in the room. More transparency is needed. We tend to hide, or at least not advertise, our playbooks for fear the other side will use them to launch counter-offenses, which we are sure would be far better funded and more warmly received by the media than our own efforts.

Joseph Bast,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joseph-bast/,"8:10] HSB: “You mentioned climate. Let’s get to that. Under your leadership, the Heartland Institute became a leader and has been recognized as such in the realm of climate science, economics, and policy. Why did the Heartland Institute become so deeply involved in this one issue? What did you see that others didn’t about the importance of climate change as an issue, and what impact has Heartland’s efforts had? B: “Well, Heartland started addressing climate actually way back, ah, 1994…1995. We did our first book that had a chapter on climate change in it. We addressed it primarily from an economic perspective, arguing that the cost of reducing emissions was really high compared to the sketchy evidence that we had about the cost of harms and offsetting benefits. Nobody listened to us. We did three, four, or five I thought really good policy studies on this topic looking specifically for example, at a carbon tax on agriculture, and the studies got almost no attention It turns out the reason they got no attention is because people were afraid of catastrophic climate change. When the building is on fire, people don’t argue or negotiate the price of fire extinguishers; they’re all too busy running for the doors, and so we concluded that we had to put the fire out before we can get a reasonable conversation to take place here. We’ve go to address this underlying fear of catastrophic climate change. So we did a deep dive in 2007; we said, where is this fear coming from? Is it based on sound science? Who are the scientists who are in this debate? Do they need our help? Why aren’t they getting a better hearing? And why aren’t Cato, and Heritage, and AEI, and other think tanks engaged in this part of the debate? And what we learned was that virtually none of the free market think tanks were addressing the science. They weren’t doing that because they felt it wasn’t their job. They’re mostly economists and lawyers and they didn’t want to start getting into the physics of climate change. I respect that. But the result was a gap: there was no free market voice on the climate science debate that was taking place, and that was a critical error on the part of free market activists. Unless we address the science, we are going to lose this debate. So we recruited scientists from all around the country. We ended up producing the series called Climate Change Reconsidered for the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change. We had a tremendous impact. I mean, it’s quite remarkable. That book, that series of books, has been cited over 100 times in peer-reviewed articles. The Chinese Academy of Sciences thought so highly of it that it translated it into Chinese and published a condensed volume of Climate Change Reconsidered."

People who expected all along that global warming was junk science, that they would rather have good jobs and inexpensive energy than pursue some liberal dream of, you know, replacing all fossil fuel with wind and solar power."
Joseph Bast,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joseph-bast/,"So Trump ran on that. He won, and it’s been remarkable: for the last year, he’s been implementing many of the promises that he made as a candidate."
Joseph Bast,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joseph-bast/,"Now Donald Trump wasn’t the first choice for most of us. He might not even have been the final choice, but the alternative was truly scary. You know, Hillary Clinton was committed to finishing what Barack Obama started, and that was pretty much destroying the local decentralized education system in America—replacing it with a centralized curriculum. Destroying the decentralized health care system that used to depend primarily on private insurance companies and doctors in private practice. So replacing that with Obamacare, destroying the financial sector I mean all the commanding heights of a free society, President Obama targeted and did major damage for eight years, and for whatever reasons Congress and the courts didn’t seem able to stop him. Hillary Clinton was committed to waging that war for another four years. I’m not sure we could have recovered from that. So we got a second chance at freedom with the election of Donald Trump. Incidentally I decided to step down, now, before the election of Donald Trump, so if anyone is wondering if that influenced my decision it didn’t. But it was a second chance we probably didn’t deserve to preserve freedom in America. It’s very precarious. It is perched on an edge. And so I’m very anxious about the future of freedom,"
Joseph Bast,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joseph-bast/,"What will Heartland Institute’s role be in that? I am optimistic. I think Heartland is going to grow. There’s a much bigger niche for what we do than what I was able to raise money for to fill. You know, I raised about six million dollars a year for the Heartland Institute. We should be at eight or ten. We should have twenty, twenty five guys working in our, just in our government relations office working with state legislators, giving them the information that they need, testifying when they need testimony, helping them draft legislation. I mean, this is all exciting stuff that they’re asking us to do and we don’t have the staff to do it. o I think under Tim Huelskamp’s leadership we’re going to raise that money. We’re going to expand the staff and fill that niche. So Heartland should be doing well in future years.

Beacon Center of Tennessee,United States,https://www.desmog.com/beacon-center-of-tennessee/,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a three atom molecule that humans produce with every exhale. Over the past decade, the belief has been propagated that excessive CO2 in the atmosphere leads to intense global warming that, if continued unabated, would cause glaciers to melt, rising the seas and engulfing coastal cities from San Francisco to New York. Despite tens of thousands of scientists signing petitions and stating their cases against the correlation between CO2 and rising temperatures, the link has been advocated by politicians and celebrities alike. Many of global warming’s supporters have no background in science and have convinced others of the CO2-global warming relationship without adequate proof. Even as people begin to realize that these ideas lack credibility, as evidenced by the change in terminology from ‘global warming’ to ‘climate change,’ politicians have continued to propose legislation to limit CO2 emissions erhaps it is important to address how some have come to the idea that limiting CO2 will have a positive impact on the environment. To reach this conclusion, one much first accept that global temperatures are rising, that human activity is responsible for the rise, and that limiting carbon emissions will alleviate this global warming. Many feel that limiting carbon emissions is a function that can only be performed by government. However, one should examine what types of interests would benefit from carbon emission limitations. Environmental groups have a bias towards findings of environmental damage and often rely on university research to endorse their claims. Research universities are predominantly funded by government, and in order to continue receiving grant funds, have an incentive to produce research that supports ideas maintained by government officials, such as the connection between CO2 and global warming. Intervention follows as a way to expand the federal government’s control over a large swath of the economy."

It’s the only logical explanation, because there is no scientific justification for banning an industry that has created billions upon billions of dollars in new wealth and is single-handedly responsible for 63 percent of the drop in U.S. carbon emissions over the past decade, according to the International Energy Agency Never mind that this industry can improve the state’s economy and bring in sorely needed jobs and tax revenue. The ban gives a bunch of clueless tree huggers the willies, so the entire state gets to suffer. Historian Paul Johnson once wrote that modern environmentalism is ‘emotionalism masquerading as science.’ That is certainly proving to be the case in Oregon, and the House has decided to be swept along in hysteria."

Now that he is president, it is time for him to make good on that promise. Simply, one cannot ‘Make America Great Again’ if America is still shackled to the Paris Climate Treaty, which seeks emissions reductions from the United States that are incompatible with economic growth and job creation Instead of keeping the United States tied to this albatross of an agreement that promotes even more taxes, regulations, and subsidies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, President Trump should withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Treaty and support sound environmental stewardship that is pro-energy, pro-environment, and pro-jobs. Doing so would produce enormous economic dividends that would genuinely improve people’s lives."

Reynald Du Berger,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/reynald-du-berger/,"There is no climate emergencyA global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message. Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific. Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warmingThe geological archive reveals that Earth’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, withnatural cold and warm phases. The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850. Therefore, it is nosurprise that we now are experiencing a period of warming Warming is far slower than predictedThe world has warmed at less than half the originally-predicted rate, and at less than half the rate to be expected on the basis of net anthropogenic forcing and radiative imbalance. It tells us that we are far from understanding climate change Climate policy relies on inadequate modelsClimate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as policy tools. Moreover, they most likely exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2. In addition, they ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial CO2 is plant food, the basis of all life on EarthCO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide Global warming has not increased natural disastersThere is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent. However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and bats, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests Climate policy must respect scientific and economic realitiesThere is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. If better approaches emerge, we will have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times, and throughout the world."

Ultimately, this system will create a national energy tax in the short term and has implications that may harm free trade in the future.

William Briggs,United States,https://www.desmog.com/william-briggs/,"All know the acronym/phrase ‘LGBT’ is shorthand for an ever-expanding list of kinds of sexual desire. We began with LGBT and we are now at LGBTQWERTY, or whatever. I used to be derisive of lists like that, but I now believe this is the one thing sexual desire ideologues get right It really is true that sexual desire is broad, much broader than we used to understand. A man may desire sex, or more usually simulated sex, with himself, with another man, with a child, with a couch on the side of a road (a real case), with a goat, with another man’s wife, with a dead body, with those missing limbs because they are missing limbs, with only females of certain races, with men who pretend to be women, and on and on and on He may desire sex (or simulated sex) in one way today and another tomorrow. Desire can be fluid. For instance, many men do not realize that they desire simulated sex with other men until they are introduced to the concept from older men. And we recall that some men who were called ‘gay’ have fathered children. The number of possible propensities, or ‘orientations,’ is practically infinite … It is thus no surprise that the man who defines himself by his temptations is the man more likely to slip. Since desire is fluid and temptations are as many, as orientation ideologues say, it is also no surprise that this class of men is more likely to sin in many different ways. And that is precisely what is observed This is why the idea to fix the scandal by having priests openly define themselves as their temptations, as advocated by among others the Washington Post, will only make everything worse The Church instead needs to return to a proper understanding of the nature of man."

Once we began identifying ourselves as our sexual desires — you are not a man but a ‘gay’ or a ‘straight’ or one of dozens of other ‘orientations’ — it was only a matter of time before every sexual desire got its own ‘rights’ and in the same way Heine began at ‘anger and disgust’ over pedophilia, but her ‘perspective [was] completely changed’ after she heard of Jonas’s ‘cruel fate. It took between thirty and forty years for homosexuality to turn from revulsion to Pride. It took Heine only a fraction of the time for her conversion. How long will it take us?"

Combined with the steps he has taken to enact his America First energy plan, these actions have contributed to the country’s strong growth during the first year of the Trump administration. Based on recent business investment and consumer confidence polls, President Trump’s policies are reinvigorating the economy During his first State of the Union speech, President Trump was more than justified in touting his accomplishments so far. Under President Trump, the United States has increased energy production, reduced regulations, and cut taxes. Because of this, the United States is once again exporting freedom and prosperity around the globe Having said all this, there is still more to do. Unfortunately, most of the cities with major ports, including all those along the West Coast, are in blue states run by Democratic governors. These vital states remain stuck in the grips of radical environmental ideologies. The Trump administration, working with Congress, must get new coal, oil, and natural gas export terminals built as part of an infrastructure plan. State recalcitrance should not be allowed to interfere with interstate and international commerce that, constitutionally, is the domain of the federal government."
H.

Nigel Calder,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/nigel-calder/,"It’s likely that CO2 has some warming effect, but real proof of that hypothesis is tricky.

Very likely. Adding a regressive charge to the oil sands, one that bites harder at low prices than high prices, introduces additional cost and risk. This will impair recovery of marginal resource associated with existing projects. And make new projects less competitive from a portfolio perspective.

Oren Cass,United States,https://www.desmog.com/oren-cass/,"The scientific consensus holds that the climate is warming and human activity plays a substantial role. But there is no consensus about how much warming human activity has caused or will cause. … [W]hile extreme climate change is a quintessentially worrying problem, it is also one that has no guarantee or even likelihood of occurring. Certainly, the ‘scientific consensus’ or even the ‘scientific mainstream’ on climate change does not extend to confidence in such scenarios To compare extreme climate change with other worrying problems, it is helpful to consider the dimensions that make a problem ‘worrying’: that it is forecasted, irreversible, and pervasive. On all three, climate change appears less worrying than most."
Oren Cass,United States,https://www.desmog.com/oren-cass/,"There is a consensus among climate scientists that human activity is contributing to climate change. However, claims that rising temperatures pose an existential threat to the human race or modern civilization are not well supported by climate science or economics; to the contrary, they are every bit as far from the mainstream as claims that climate change is not occurring or that it will be beneficial. Analyses consistently show that the costs of climate change are real but manageable. For instance, the prosperity that the world might achieve in 2100 without climate change may instead be delayed until 2102,"
Oren Cass,United States,https://www.desmog.com/oren-cass/,"I am convinced by the scientific consensus on climate change, but I would still slam the door in the face of anyone who came to me with that offer.

Oren Cass,United States,https://www.desmog.com/oren-cass/,"Unless the scientific community is perpetrating an unprecedented hoax, the existence of such a widespread consensus indicates at least a significant likelihood of a real danger, which presents policymakers with an actual risk deserving of serious consideration ccepting the science does not, however, require one to accept the liberal policy prescriptions.  Science is only an input to any policy discussion, and nowhere is this truer than in the case of climate change, where the scientific consensus resolves remarkably little. More carbon in the atmosphere leads to warming, but how much warming? Scientists speak in terms of ‘climate sensitivity — how sensitive is the climate to some increase in carbon dioxide?

The studies neither explore how these children were exposed to phthalates nor show that phthalates actually cause health problems dditionally, the phthalates explored by these studies, DINP and DIDP, are also not typically used in microwavable plastic, though viewers were advised to avoid microwaving plastic.

John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,"There’s a little bit of hyperbole in things that people see changing right now,"
John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,"The messages of the two points outlined in the extract above are: (1) the claims about increases in frequency and intensity of extreme events are generally not supported by actual observations and, (2) official information about climate science is largely controlled by agencies through (a) funding choices for research and (b) by the carefullyselected (i.e. biased) authorship of reports such as the EPA Endangerment Finding and the National Climate Assessment."
John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,"[W]e are not morally bad people for taking carbon and turning it into the energy that offers life to humanity in a world that would otherwise be brutal (think of life before modernity). On the contrary, we are good people for doing so,"
John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,"The American Meteorological Society did their survey and they specifically asked the question, Is man the dominate controller of climate over the last 50 years? Only 52 percent said yes. That is not a consensus at all in science … Roy and I have both made the statement that we are in the 97 percent because we believe in some (man-made) effect."
John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,"Spencer and Christy each authored five papers captured in our climate science literature survey. Among those papers, we classified one of Spencer’s and two of Christy’s as minimizing or rejecting the human influence on global warming, and the others as not taking a position on the issue.  hat makes both of them authors of the less than 3% of peer-reviewed climate science papers rejecting the consensus on human-caused global warming. This is an indisputable fact – the 97% consensus figure is based on our team’s categorization of the scientific literature, and we put their research outside the 97% consensus."
John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,"NASA, NOAA, EPA, DOE, those are agencies. Agency leaders are appointed by the government, by the current administration. They do not represent objective independent scientific organizations,"
John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,Carbon dioxide makes things grow. The world used to have five times as much carbon dioxide as it does now. Plants love this stuff. It creates more food. CO2 is not the problem … There is absolutely no question that carbon energy provides with longer and better lives. There is no question about that.
John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,"For example, John Christy showed this figure, A not equal to B, and was asked by one of the physicists in the room, well, why? Why, Professor Christy, what’s going on? How do you explain this divergence in warming rates between the models and the observations? What’s going on there? And John, Christy shrugged his shoulders and said Mother Nature’s going to do what Mother Nature’s going to do."
John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,"My comment to the committee when something like that was asked to me a month ago was, ‘Mother Nature has within her all the necessary tools to generate extreme events that exceed what we have seen in the past 50 years.’ So, whatever we have seen out there, Mother Nature already has the ability to do it."
John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,"Of course, those isotopic measurements have been made by labs around the world. You know, it’s very, very well established science. But John Christie did not agree. And when Professor Koonin asked him, well, why don’t you agree? John Christie said, because I did not make the measurements myself. And again, you could sort of see the amazement in in the room, the the import of that statement is that I am not going to trust anyone else, no measurements unless I’ve made them myself."
John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,"So the red the red team lost, the red team was not convincing to the members of the American Physical Society, Steve Koonin stepped down as chair of this subcommittee charged with updating the statement. And now he’s calling for the same red team blue team process, even though the process that he presided over. Did not yield a result that that he liked, that he was comfortable with."

John Christy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/john-christy/,"I showed some evidence that humans are causing warming in the surface measurements that we have, but it is not the greenhouse relation,"
Petr Chylek,"Canada, United States",https://www.desmog.com/petr-chylek/,"A common view on the current climate change (global warming) is that it is a result of fossil fuel burning and the following increase in atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide.

Petr Chylek,"Canada, United States",https://www.desmog.com/petr-chylek/,"Thus, two of the three pillars of the global warming and carbon dioxide paradigm are open to reinvestigation.The damage has been done. The public trust in climate science has been eroded. At least a part of the IPCC 2007 report has been put in question. We cannot blame it on a few irresponsible individuals.

Ian Clark,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/ian-clark/,"I am compelled to disagree that there is a consensus of scientists who agree that this [climate change] is the consequence of human activities. While the melting of permafrost, retreat of glaciers and waning of the permanent ice pack may be alarming, it is only alarming to those unfamiliar with past changes in climate in the North. Paleoclimatologists recognize such events as part of natural changes wholly unrelated to CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. In fact, the waxing and waning of ice shelves, along with glaciers, ice caps and pack ice are largely related to changes in solar inputs."
Ian Clark,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/ian-clark/,"ctober 17, 202 Everybody overlooks the fact that CO2 really is the essence of life,"
Ian Clark,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/ian-clark/,"The Earth has supported abundant life many times in the geological past when there were much higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is quite likely that future generations will benefit from the enrichment of Earth’s atmosphere with more carbon dioxide Make no mistake, the agitators are not defending science from quackery — quite the contrary!"
Ian Clark,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/ian-clark/,"The pollution and emissions from the oil sands have been greatly exaggerated. Killing the oil sands would be to the great detriment of all Canadians, from aboriginal groups to engineers and other workers alike. It is greener energy than many other sources."
Ian Clark,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/ian-clark/,"The oil sands contribute very, very little to global CO2. If one believes in global warming, then one must accept that the oil sands contribute very, very little to warming.

Following the 1980 campaign, many of Clark’s key supporters appear to have lost interest in the party, and a number of them drifted away."

Ed Clark,United States,https://www.desmog.com/ed-clark/,"If Ed Clark is elected President he will let the free market work…[H]e will eliminate all subsidies to energy producers. Oil companies and other energy firms should have to make it on their own without shifting their risks to the taxpayers. Specifically, a Clark administration will abolish the Department of Energy, whose only functions are to interfere with energy production and distribution and hand out subsides. We will repeal all price and import controls, allowing supply and demand to set energy prices."

Ed Clark,United States,https://www.desmog.com/ed-clark/,": “How would you achieve a balance between the need for economic growth and protection of the environment? : “Present government-imposed environmental standards are arbitrary, haphazard, inconsistent, and political. Agencies are criticized by environmentalist for being slow to respond to problems, and by businesses for imposing costly and cumbersome regulations- and both complaints have much validity. I favor a totally different system whereby individuals and groups can file suit against polluters, prove damages, win compensation, and enjoin polluters from continuing to pollute; such a system is based on strict enforcement of property rights. At present, government has the sole power to determine the acceptable level of pollution. This fails to protect consumers, who have no recourse if the level is set too low and it fails to protect industry, which is often forced to comply with burdensome regulations. Economic growth and environmental protection will both be better protected by a system of private legal action to uphold property rights than by government standards."
Ed Clark,United States,https://www.desmog.com/ed-clark/,"In the field of energy, as in every other field, that government is best which governs least. I advocate the abolition of the Department of Energy — whose annual budget is greater than the after-tax profits of all the major oil companies combined — and an immediate end to energy subsidies, price controls, and all government allocation programs. If we ended price controls and allocation programs, allowing prices to reflect real conditions of scarcity in the world today, there would be no shortages of oil and gas, and individuals would be free to conserve energy in way that they — not the authoritarian government — find agreeable. For decades now, government involvement in energy has lead [sic] to a steady, progressive worsening of our energy problems. Only a sharp move away from government domination and towards a truly free market in energy can solve our energy crisis — a crisis made in Washington."

Ed Clark,United States,https://www.desmog.com/ed-clark/,"The elimination of the proposed $8.7 billion for the Department of Energy would lower taxes and help revitalize our domestic energy industry. America needs free market energy. Instead, the Carter Administration proposes a windfall profits tax that will take over where stifling price controls and the perverse entitlement system left off. This new tax will continue to make it more difficult for domestic exploration and drilling operations to compete with foreign crude, and will help fund a corporate welfare package for synfuels and an Energy Security Corporation. We do not need a $13 billion Department of Education. We need tax credits for anyone who sends a child to a private, voluntary school.

Ross Clark,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/ross-clark/,To hear today’s reaction to the news that Michael Gove has granted permission to build Britain’s first deep coal mine for a generation is to step through the looking glass into a bizarre world where a Conservative government is considered evil for helping to create mining jobs in a de-industrialised region – and the ‘enlightened’ position is to eradicate the very last traces of the coal industry.
Ross Clark,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/ross-clark/,"For the benefit of climate activists who live under the delusion that anyone who fails to share their belief must be in the pay of big oil, I am not part of the bonanza – I have avoided investing directly in fossil fuel companies for several years specifically so that no one can level that claim at me."

Ross Clark,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/ross-clark/,"Children will be taught, for example, the ‘impact of diet choices for land usage and environmental impact’ […] That isn’t educating children to think for themselves; it is trying to train them to be the next generation of environmental activists."
Ross Clark,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/ross-clark/,"It has been a received wisdom among many in government, opposition and in the great green blob that switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy would make us better off. How laughable that claim seems now."
Ross Clark,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/ross-clark/,"It is right to build new homes to high energy efficiency standards, but it is sadly all too easy to predict the result of a rushed scheme to retrofit all existing homes to make them zero carbon. Homeowners will be fleeced, left with damp, chilly homes. Worse, the costs are bound to fall disproportionately on the lowest- income homeowners."
Ross Clark,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/ross-clark/,"For one thing, the ambition of many countries to go carbon-neutral by 2050 does not necessarily mean that it will be achieved. Such a vast change to the economy relies on a combination of new technologies becoming economic on a commercial scale by that date. We still don’t know, for example, how we are going to store energy generated by intermittent wind and solar farms."
Ross Clark,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/ross-clark/,"We shouldn’t allow energy policy to be dominated by generation alone, as it has been for years – we have had subsidies galore for power generators with rather less investment in the grid. It is no use generating large quantities of green power if we don’t have the infrastructure to cope with it. That way lies only mass power cuts."
Ross Clark,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/ross-clark/,"Extinction Rebellion is quite different in that it openly advocates lower living standards. It actively wants to reverse economic growth. It is, as a result, an indulgence on the part of people who feel divorced from economic forces and who don’t feel they need to engage with what would be the realities of a shrinking economy: mass unemployment and millions struggling to feed and clothe their families."
Ross Clark,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/ross-clark/,"Divestment is nothing more than a pathetic case of virtue-signalling, carried out by people who know full well that we rely on oil and gas companies to keep the economy going and will do so for a long time yet."
Ross Clark,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/ross-clark/,"It is little wonder that terrified kids are skipping school to protest against climate change. Never mind climate change denial, a worse problem is the constant exaggeration of the subject.

We know that government policies offer great economic pain and no environmental gain. We also know that the global warming issue has produced intellectual deception and the subversion of the scientific process, widespread corporate rent seeking, and the gross waste of resources that could have gone to improve our environment.

This is because the global ecosystem in 2030 might still be in a transient, headed for much more significant effects after time lags perhaps of the order of decades.

Issues like the Medieval warm period, different possible causes of climate change (such as solar activity, or even the nature of our climate), studies indicating the last interglacial period was warmer than today, and the failure of recent dire predictions about the climate all show the debate on climate change is not nearly as settled as many global warming proponents would have us believe. Almost no research has been done to determine if climate change is a natural phenomenon, and recent studies indicate there has been no global warming in the last 19 years. Some scientists are even saying we are nearing the beginning of a new period of global cooling.

With the new name came a redesigned website, highly produced web videos, and an organized network of churches to distribute climate change denying propaganda to hundreds of pastors around the country. The branding for the Cornwall Alliance is derived from the ‘Cornwall Declaration,’ a 1999 document pushing back against the creation-care movement in the evangelical community. The Declaration ‘stressed a free-market environmental stewardship and emphasized that individuals and private organizations should be trusted to care for their own property without government intervention.’"

Both apply only to the things it occurs to the planners to regulate or subsidize,"
Andrew Coyne,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/andrew-coyne/,"Indigenous people, rather than being the helpless victims of development, could be partners in it, with appropriate mitigation of costs and sharing of benefits. Carbon pricing, instead of impeding resource extraction, could make it more possible, if not by purchasing social licence directly, then by encouraging the reductions in emissions intensity that would do so in the long run. [… People who think we can just shut down the oil sands today have not remotely contended with the consequences, not only for the economy, but the federal union. People who think we can just do nothing about climate change make themselves permanent exiles from power But that, alas, is what too many people do think. Only when all sides dispense with the fantasy of total victory will there be a way out of this stalemate."
Andrew Coyne,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/andrew-coyne/,"This is the dirty little secret the anti-carbon tax folks would prefer you did not know. You can try to cut emissions by other ways: regulations on business are a particular favourite. But those come with costs just as surely as a carbon tax does — every dollar of which would be passed on to the same ‘hard-working families’ the critics pretend to care about,"
Andrew Coyne,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/andrew-coyne/,"The supposition is that unless emissions are reduced globally, there’s no point. But you could just as well make the case that there’s no point anyway. With just 1.6 per cent of global emissions, we’re more or less irrelevant, as far as saving the planet is concerned. That’s not an argument for doing nothing. It’s an argument for doing our part — as long as we are under no illusions what ‘our part’ means Climate change is an example of a collective action problem. Though each country might make very little difference on its own, together they make a great deal of difference. Yet if every country, following the logic of its own unimportance, did nothing, no one would do anything"

At the international level, it can only really be by agreement — though there may be penalties for non-compliance. Living up to our promised emissions reductions isn’t about saving the world so much as staying onside with the world, if for no other reason than there may be costs to not doing so The choice facing us as a country, then, is rather like that facing a company under a carbon tax: to reduce emissions, so long as it is less costly than the alternative. One implication of that is we should do so in the least costly way possible, namely by taxing carbon. At some point, if we keep piling on unnecessary costs, it will be cheaper to renege."

The temperature standstill was not predicted by climate scientists, leaving them struggling to rationalize its significance [… ven if climate science is as robust as the president asserts, in the absence of a global agreement on carbon emissions, mandates and subsidies to produce renewable energy will have negligible impact on global temperatures and on the weather. A 1998 study on the effect of the Kyoto Protocol estimated that, if fully implemented, it would delay the rise in global temperatures by four to 14 years over the course of the current century and have a minimal effect on the rise of sea levels.

Phase II cooling will begin around the year 2020, this will usher in very dramatic global cooling, hurling temperatures quickly back to where they were in the cold 1950s and 1960s, and then further back to the climate seen in the 1800s. Coldest temperatures will be from about the year 2024 to 2050. There will be rapid ice pack regeneration until the peak of the next global warming cycle in the year 2140.

A warming world might moderate global energy demand: the rise in temperature so far has mostly expressed itself as milder winters, not hotter summers. Warming might open vast areas of Alaska, Canada and Russia to development…  Scientific substantiation of a warming world is not necessarily reason for gloom. Greenhouse gases are an air pollution problem, and all air pollution problems of the past have cost significantly less to fix than critics projected, and the solutions have worked faster than expected."

Over 80% of homes rely on natural gas to heat their homes and renewables can’t replace this demand at the moment By replacing liquefied natural gas imports and continuing to decrease reliance on coal, with shale gas produced onshore, we will reduce the UK’s carbon footprint and provide a cost-effective source of energy for our homes, businesses and industry."
Francis Egan,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/francis-egan/,"Well the climate change committee squared that and the government squared it But in terms of how I square it is that we’re going to need gas and that’s going to have to fit into emissions targets or we’re going to have shut off the heating and the cooking in the country, and that’s not going to happen. So really, what we have to demonstrate is that we can produce gas at lower emissions than we can import it You’ve got to remember that emissions for us is revenue. So we’re burning dollars or pounds so in terms of emissions, people say we have to be heavily regulated. We don’t have to be heavily regulated, that’s our profit. It’s like Tesco’s throwing away its food. So with best practice you can get down to less than one percent and there’s no reason in the UK why we can’t get down to less than one percent emissions."

If all of our electricity was generated by renewable energy, that would still only cut our gas consumption by a third. Two- thirds of the gas used in this country is used in central heating or cooking or by industry. Where is that going to come from?

Alex Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/alex-epstein/,[T]oday’s vaunted “climate science consensus
Alex Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/alex-epstein/,"In my opinion, the time for debate is certainly not over because the vast majority of us don’t even know what the debate is about — let alone what has been proven and what hasn’t, let alone what action implications all of this has."
Alex Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/alex-epstein/,"It’s kind of obvious if you have a warmer world with more CO2, it’s a more tropical world with more life. It’s a more green world in the life sense of green. And yet the green movement hates it because we caused it. So they can see no good in anything we caused, even when it leads to more biological productivity. It’s fundamentally an anti-human movement, not a pro-life-of-any- kind movement."
Alex Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/alex-epstein/,"You know, one thing I’ve been saying lately is I think it’s just really important that people associate the California blackouts with green energy and the California wildfires with green forestry,"
Alex Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/alex-epstein/,"lex Epstein: [00:37:10] We’re all taught that climate is bad and getting worse. And yet climate from a human perspective is safer than ever by far. So anyone I have a line that I like to use, which is I don’t trust anyone to predict the future, who can’t predict the present. So if somebody says climate is going to be a disaster in the future and they think climate is a disaster today, they are ignorant or worse. And I think they are worse. [00:37:35 00:37:48] Because if you have a human perspective on climate livability, you have to admit it’s gotten much better. But if you think that it’s wrong for human beings to have any impact on the climate. And if we have any impact, that means it’s a bad climate, then you think the climate is worse. And that’s the only explanation of climate that the climate catastrophe movement thinking today’s climate is bad because they think it’s bad because they think we’ve changed it some. And so it’s really a religion. It’s really a religion that says that to be good is to not change nature.  [00:38:18 00:38:19] That’s their standard. That’s their goal is unchanged nature. And my goal is human flourishing. I want humans to live to their highest potential. So if we make the Earth amazing with machine power and it leads to a little warming, which, by the way, is generally desirable for people, and by the way, it also leads to greening of plants.  [00:38:35 00:38:36] If we change the Earth in that way, along with all the positive ways that our machines change the Earth using fossil fuels, I think that’s a better earth because I care about humans. But if you think it’s bad for human beings to change anything, you’re gonna think it’s what we’ve done is bad. Even though a billion people can live better lives than ever, that’s the only explanation of our whole establishment. Acting like climate is bad and the world is bad is they are antihuman.  [00:39:02 00:39:19] But once you know the facts about the world, you have to know that there’s something antihuman about the people who are telling you that it’s bad and getting worse. [00:39:27 00:50:07]  If you recognize there is no optimal state of the planet, the planet is naturally dynamic. It’s naturally dangerous. It’s naturally deficient. It’s a very imperfect planet. It’s got a lot of potential. But that potential needs to be actualized.  [00:50:21 00:53:46] Property rights are just so unappreciated in terms of how they enable individuals to coexist in harmony with one another and to have a proper pro human relationship to nature.  [00:53:58 00:54:13] But we unfortunately have almost and I mean this technically like a fascist system when it comes to the relationship to nature, where basically a government like the EPA or some other entity can just say, you know what, the muskrat on your property. We think that’s important. So you’ve got to leave or you can’t do what you want. And and there’s this real tyranny that happens. I think it’s an anti human view. I think if you care about the muskrat, you go be productive and figure out a way to predict that muskrat yourself, because otherwise people don’t care about the muskrat.  [00:54:46 00:55:05] And if you just talk to business people in the U.S. about how they say the Endangered Species Act persecutes them, it is unbelievable. Or we had this, um, it was like some waters act in the US that the president, Donald Trump, did a good job of repealing or delimiting. And it was just like if you had a puddle on your property, basically some eco fascist could say, yeah, you know what? That’s a really important puddle. I guess you can’t use it. And that’s that’s not how America became a beautiful place. You know, it became a beautiful place, I think, where there’s more property rights.  [00:55:38 00:55:46] I think that if we had property rights, we could have a true enjoyment of nature that was actually pro human.  [00:55:53 00:59:52] I think what’s going on in terms of the climate catastrophism, I don’t think it’s actually really a disagreement about science or certainly any fact.  I think it’s a very deep antihuman orientation.  [01:00:05 01:00:05] And it’s this idea I keep coming back to the view that changing nature is bad or human impact is is bad. Because if you look at the situation and you think about let’s say you learn two facts about CO2 that at least in that. So it’s a it’s a plant growing gas and it’s a fertilizing gas. You know that. And let’s say in isolation at least it’s a warming gas, at least I. I certainly believe that. So it’s a warming gass. So it has those two attributes. So you might think, let’s say fossil fuels, instead of adding CO2 to the atmosphere, they subtracted CO2 from the atmosphere. So if you just knew, OK, it’s a fertilizing gas and a warming gas and you heard fossil fuels as a side effect or a byproduct, they’re sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere.  [01:00:49 01:00:50] What would be your reaction? I think you’d be pretty afraid.  [01:00:54 01:02:18] Leaving aside anything you knew about the details of climate science, if it was taking CO2 out of the atmosphere, you would be worried 01:02:25] But then if you’re oh, it’s just from these basic facts, it’s adding CO2 to the atmosphere. You’d think, oh, well, that’s probably gonna be pretty good for the plants. And we use a lot of plants because we either eat them directly or the animals we eat eat plants. So that’s going to increase our agricultural productivity. And it’s also going to just increase the amount of biomass around the world which is going to mean that all species have more stuff to feed on.  [01:02:46 01:03:00] So what’s really interesting is that people, before they even hear about the different views on climate science, their expectation is that the world is going to get worse if we add CO2. Why is that? It’s not because of the nature of CO2. It’s because of the religious dogma that impacting nature is bad. It’s impacting nature is viewed as immoral. It’s just wrong for us to impact things and it’s viewed as inevitably self-destructive. [01:03:26 01:03:59] So it warms place in the coldest places in the world that we want to be more warm. And it warms more at night when we want it to be more warm and it warms more in the winter. So if you learn that the world is becoming a more tropical place, you would think that’s a desirable thing. Most people will like that. The only thing you could possibly be concerned about is is there some way that the warmth is so much or that there’s some trajectory of CO2 that so much that it’s just going to become way warmer than our tropical ancestors had? But then if you look at the nature of it, the effect I mean, if you just look at the history of the planet, CO2 levels used to be fifteen times higher than they are today in Fahrenheit, which I use emperatures twenty five degrees warmer. And life was incredibly productive at those times, the planet didn’t burn up. So if you know that we have no way, even if we wanted to. Of even getting one third of the way to what CO2 levels used to. Like we have no way of doing that. And then you think so? How could it be that they CO2 could warm things that much? And then you look at how CO2 works in isolation ou see, it’s what’s called a logarithmic has a logarithmic effect, which is you can think of it as a decelerating effect, which basically means each new molecule of CO2 adds less warmth than the last one. So you keep adding. So somebody uses the analogy of like, you know, you paint a barn and you’re painting it red. And like the first coat of paint is like, you know, you make it. It’s like a little red and then you can make it redder. But after a while, it stops t doesn’t become much redder because it’s already pretty red. And that’s basically how CO2 works. It’s like every new coat of it or every new amount of it. It warms some, but it warms less than the last. How could a decel… a warming gas with a decelerating affect that has been 15 times higher in the future and life has thrived at twenty five degrees warmer temperature? How could that possibly be a catastrophe for a species that is by far the most adaptable in history ecause billions of people have machine power that they can thrive in any climate. How could that possibly be a catastrophe? The only way you can think that is if you do not recognize how good human beings make the planet. The planet is naturally dynamic, deficient, dangerous and deficient, and that human productivity using machine power makes it it better. You can only believe this if you have this dogma that the planet is perfect, that any change to it is immoral and disastrous. But that’s a religion that is not science at all. And it is the most irrational, I’m not… any religion…But that is the most irrational religion I have ever heard of. [01:06:43 01:10:05] Yes. So I just want to sort of situate my own position here. So, I mean, my my main position is that the climate catastrophe movement is a religious and unscientific movement. But what I just want to emphasize that the morality of using fossil fuels, of using more and more fossil fuels going forward, does not depend on them having zero impact on climate. I think it’s very hard to know, certainly if you’re a layman, what’s going on. Because there’s so much distortion and there’s so much of an assumption that, of course, CO2 must have a big impact. After all, it’s on we’re putting an unnatural amount. But even if we are causing significant warming, particularly because, you know, it’s a decelerating function, that is no reason at all to stop using fossil fuels and empowering human rights. So I just want to. Sometimes people get into the climate issue and they act like the case for fossil fuels depends on zero or little impact of fossil fuels on climate.  [01:11:00 01:11:01] And it it does not because we can use the fossil fuels to make any climate safer as long as we we’re free to use fossil fuels and get machine power. And if we’re not free, then any climate, including the supposedly perfect natural climate, is dangerous and unlivable. [01:11:17 01:14:43] my view is certainly that the utility of knowing that CO2 levels used to be a lot higher. It has a lot of utility because it it would be different if we had never we were at a threshold of CO2 that had never been exceeded, versus if you know. Oh, it’s been 15 times higher than it was today. And there are other variables that are different. But clearly, it is not something where the planet burns up. The oceans. Nothing like nothing like that happens in general. Life flourishes. The only thing. So the only thing I think you could be legitimately concerned about, but it has to be a pretty small concern in the scheme of things is will warming cause sea level rise that will be inconveniently fast? And I don’t think there’s evidence that it is at all. But you could at least hypothetically be concerned about that with warming. [01:15:31 01:17:42] If they actually cared about protecting people from floods, they would be all for using more fossil fuels so that you could actually produce flood protection like levees and dams.  [01:17:51 01:27:11] Michael Shellenberger, one of my favorite energy commentators, the author of the new book Apocalypse Never, which is a very valuable book, like he has a good article, says, If solar and wind are so cheap, basically, why is electricity so expensive? [01:27:23 01:28:30] The idea when people talk about a hundred percent renewable, mostly solar and wind, even for electricity, and they talk about it for all energy, that is a policy that is equal parts ignorant and genocidal. And so that means you, Joe Biden, like you talking about that is like you are basically saying, I want to kill a whole bunch of Americans. [01:28:51 01:31:40] So we if we want to live, we want billions of people to live and to be empowered with machine power. Then we need more fossil fuels, not less. That’s the moral case for fossil fuels. And fortunately, I’m not. Fortunately, the CO2 is probably a net benefit, but it’s certainly nothing resembling a catastrophe. So that’s that’s even better. [01:32:02 01:57:21] There’s this idea that if calling the green movement the watermelon movement because it’s green on the outside and red on the inside, red as in communistic. And there’s a lot of truth to that. But if you think about it, the whole idea that we’re destroying the planet is the ultimate pretext for restricting freedom because it basically says anything we do productively is bad.  [01:57:43 01:57:44] And so the government gets to control us. And to the people who hate achievement or productivity, that checks a box for them because it it it says it’s basically anti-doing anything. And for the people who want control. Wow. What could be a greater thing to control than human impact and for that matter, what could be a greater thing to control than the byproduct of basically, every machine in the world, CO2. Like that is the ultimate control. So it’s it’s it’s very important.  [01:58:13 01:58:13] It’s an anti freedom movement. And when we say we’re pro fossil fuels, we’re we’re really pro is the freedom to use fossil fuels.  [01:58:21 01:58:58] So fundamentally, it’s about freedom. And fossil fuels are a product of freedom. And we only want to use them as long as they’re the best choice under freedom.  [01:59:06"

Alex Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/alex-epstein/,"rendan O’Neill: [00:02:45] What is behind the energy crisis? What is causing this extreme crisis that we are heading into right now lex Epstein: [00:02:54] The direct cause is very, very simple, and the only reason why it’s not being globally publicized is that it implicates our establishment. I’m talking about the deeper cause, but the direct cause is very simple. It’s supply and demand, and for the last fifteen-plus years, the world has been involved in a concerted effort to rapidly restrict the supply of fossil fuels, with the explicit goal of rapidly eliminating them by say 2050, and that involves opposing fossil fuel investment, fossil fuel production, fossil fuel refining, fossil fuel transportation, and so that artificially suppressed the supply of fossil fuels. And the promise was that, ‘oh well, all that demand for energy is no problem, because unreliable solar and wind will more than make up the difference.’ And that failed to materialize, and so what you have is a shortfall of supply relative to demand. nd you really saw the height of this irresponsibility in 2020, when we had lockdowns, and, you know, global pandemic, and there was this idea of, ‘oh, we’ll never really need fossil fuels again, and the industry isn’t doing well, and so, we don’t need to invest in them, and it’s okay to talk about divesting,’ and that never made any sense whatsoever. Again we’re talking about the deeper causes, but t’s just very clear that the establishment is involved in a global anti-fossil fuel movement that radically and artificially restricted the supply of this relative to what it should be, and what it would be had they not restricted it, and then that leads to these terrible consequences. [00:04:35 rendan O’Neill: [00:04:56] There is a clear link about the fact that we have essentially been demonizing energy over the past few decades, seeing energy production and energy consumption as problematic things, destructive things, which create so much pollution, so much waste, so much carbon, and the campaigns which is as you say were embraced by the establishment, the campaigns to limit our use of fossil fuels, limit our capacity to produce the energy we need, the idea that that wouldn’t then give rise to some form of energy crisis, or to a spike in energy prices, or problems with supply and demand, it seems to be a complete fantasy.

And I also take the step of, and you could as well, but, ‘I was right about this.’ Like I’ll put out a video and say ‘hey I warned you about this.’ And the reason is, it’s not to aggrandize myself, it’s that, whenever you have a crisis, who’s implicated and who’s vindicated changes the trajectory of the intellectual landscape going forward.

So it’s very important if you’re talking about let’s say, a temperature increase, is this a linear temperature increase?  Is it steady that way? Is it a logarithmic one, which means one that’s decelerating? Is it one that’s accelerating? Because that’s what we’d be really worried about. And then if somebody says that it’s accelerating, it says any of these things, what is their evidence, what actually demonstrated, and what is speculated And what was interesting in the claims that Micah brought up, every single one of them, I document in the first chapter of the book, The Secret History of Fossil Fuels, every single one of those has been made by many of the same thinkers for 35 years, and has been completely the reverse of the truth. So the claim is just there’s this dramatic warming, and you hear these predictions and oh, if we use this much coal. But the question is, what’s the track record of that claim and is it speculated or is it demonstrated? I’d say, it’s very much speculated. And the models that are used to make that claim are have been invalidated. They’ve been false over and over. So I don’t think it’s honest. And I don’t think it’s careful to act as if climate prediction models that can’t predict climate or making accurate predictions, so the responsibility to experts to acknowledge that. aron Harber: “Okay, so. And my role is, I’m the viewer. I’m someone who’s not as well informed as you four so I have lots of questions. And I’m trying to figure this out, like, what what’s really going on what’s happening? So one of your points, as I understand it, is, as the the parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, for example, goes up. And we’re, at what, right now for four hours per million right now. So one of your arguments is, is it goes to five or six, it’s not necessarily having a 25%, or a 50% increase, you’re saying it’s kind of plateauing? pstein: “I’m saying you have to look carefully at what the evidence is. Because there’s a question of what you can demonstrate in isolation, where, you know, if you shine light in a box like what can you figure out about the nature of this effect, and the point I’m making there is in isolation is a logarithmic decelerating effect. And this is something in any debate in any discussion I’ve had on this issue. The opponents of fossil fuels have never led with this point, or even mentioned it, I always have to bring it up. The implication that you get is Oh, it’s exponential, it’s accelerating. And that would be genuinely scary. arber:  “Would it be scary even if it were linear? pstein: “That’s arguable. arber"
Alex Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/alex-epstein/,"pstein: “So I mentioned with these dramatic claims of global warming, not any global warming, but disastrous, runaway global warming, we have a track record of failed claims of that. And that’s relevant to assessing the theory. And anyone claiming that theory today has to acknowledge the failed track record, be honest about it, and then explain why they still believe it. arber: “Is that a fair statement Scott? enning: (Emphasis added). “No. It’s just not a fair statement. I mean, well, so first of all, let’s look at the amount of CO2 increase that we’ve had, since the industrial revolution, about 40% more CO2 in the atmosphere. So there hasn’t been very much CO2 out of the atmosphere. And there hasn’t been much cold warning about one degree Celsius, as, as was mentioned here Since 1896, when when people first figured out this whole logarithmic you know, four watts per square meter per doubling of CO2, we have estimated that it’s about three degrees of global warming for every doubling, but we’re no where near a doubling of CO2 The amount of warming that we’ve had, is quite consistent with the amount of CO2, but it’s not just CO2. What what I was trying to make the case for before is that when you add heat to things they warm up. So we’ve had lots of experience with heat being added, you know, for example, when volcanoes go off and it shapes the earth little bit, it cools off a little bit, and the amount that it cools off matches exactly what we expect, in terms of amount of heat and amount of cooling If you look back much farther, there were ice ages, you know, long ago, since the last ice age, not not four watts, but about six and a half watts of extra heat. And it’s warmed up about five degrees Celsius So, you know, Alex proposes not to, we had a 40% increase, he would like to see several hundred percent increase in the CO2 by providing fossil fuels to the whole seven and a half billion of us nd that would add more heat in in the next hundred years, then all the heat that warmed us about in the last ice age six and a half watts to come out of the Ice Age, say, eight watts to achieve Alex’s vision. So we’re not talking about a small amount of heat, we’re talking about a huge amount of heat being added to the planet. This is not a matter of climate models. This is a matter of common sense when you add heat to things they warm up."
Alex Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/alex-epstein/,"Maybe we should question the premise behind that, that we’re really resource parasites, because in fact, what we are is we’re resource producers. Nature gives us very few usable resources. Like aluminum wasn’t a resource until we made it a resource. Oil wasn’t a resource. So we made a resource. Uranium wasn’t a resource so we made it a resource. So we’re resource creators, so we don’t have to worry about running out of any particular material and this goes to my own view, which is not ‘use fossil fuels, ‘it’s ‘be free to use fossil fuels,’ and everything else.

What if I also told you that this energy source was cheap, plentiful, and reliable ell, there is such a source. You probably know it as fossil fuel. Oil. Natural gas. Coal ut wait? Don’t fossil fuels pollute our environment and make our climate unlivable? That, of course, is what we’re told…and what our children are taught. But let’s look at the data. Here’s a graph you’ve probably never seen: the correlation between use of fossil fuels and access to clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water. Am I saying the more we that we have used fossil fuel, the cleaner our water has become? Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying n the developed world, we take clean water for granted. We turn on a tap and it’s there. But getting it there takes a massive amount of energy. Think of the man-made reservoirs, the purification plants, the network of pipes. In the undeveloped world, it’s a much different story. They lack the energy, so they lack clean water. More fossil fuel. More clean water he same is true of sanitation. By the use of cheap, plentiful, and reliable energy from fossil fuels, we have made our environment cleaner. Take a look at this graph. More fossil fuel. Better sanitation kay, what about air quality? Here’s a graph of the air pollution trends in the United States over the last half century based on data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Note the dramatic downward trend in emissions, even though we use more fossil fuel than ever. How was this achieved? Above all, by using anti-pollution technology powered by…fossil fuel: oil, natural gas and coal ut even without modern pollution control technology, fossil fuel makes our air cleaner. Indoor pollution—caused by burning a fire inside your house, cabin, hut or tent to cook and keep warm—was a deadly global problem until the late 19th century when cheap kerosene, a fossil fuel byproduct, became available in America and Europe. Indoor pollution is still a major issue in the developing world today. The best solution? Fossil fuel nd now we come to the biggest fossil fuel concern of all—global warming. On this very sensitive topic we need to get our terms straight: There is a big difference between mild global warming and catastrophic global warming. We can all agree on that, right?  The issue isn’t: does burning fossil fuel have some warming impact? It does. The issue is: is the climate warming dangerously fast n 1986 NASA climate scientist James Hansen—one of the world’s most prominent critics of the use of fossil fuels—predicted that “if current trends are unchanged,"

Richard Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/richard-epstein/,"[T]he employer will (or could be made to) disclose in advance that passing the test is a condition precedent for the job.

Richard Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/richard-epstein/,"Employers, for example, may make heavy initial investments in recruiting and training, costs that they can recoup only over time. For AIDS carriers the number of years over which that investment can be recovered is, on average, sharply reduced, no matter what assumptions are made about the rate at which AIDS carriers turn into AIDS victims. To offset this lower rate of investment return, the employer must obtain some compensating advantage from some other aspect of the employment relationship. Hiring candidates with better experience or credentials are two ways of doing so. Alternatively, the net return to the employer might be preserved if the worker accepts a lower wage in anticipation of a shorter period or a lower level of future productivity."
Richard Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/richard-epstein/,"Since the employer’s total cost includes both wages and fringe benefits with health and life insurance components, the ordinary contract will impose a net loss upon the employer, even on very modest cost assumptions."

Richard Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/richard-epstein/,"Worse still, New York is backing the wrong horse by looking to solar and wind energy as credible replacements for fossil fuels. The most powerful demonstration of this point comes from Mark Mills of the Manhattan Institute, who shows in painful detail that the technical limitations of both wind and solar power make them at best niche players. There is little chance that wind and solar energy can displace fossil fuels, which at present account for about 80 percent of the world’s energy sources. … Given the long-term dominance of fossil fuels, the far better strategy for controlling carbon dioxide, or real pollutants like sulfur dioxide, comes from shifting from coal and oil to natural gas, and from innovating new techniques in their production, shipment, and use. Fortunately, the capital costs of getting natural gas to market have been cut in half over the last five years without costly government subsidies. The lower costs will stimulate higher production of fossil fuels, but that should be regarded as a good thing, once we take into account the gains to human welfare that these expenditures generate."
Richard Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/richard-epstein/,"The defenders of the Paris Accords are as dogmatic on the science as they are on the economics. To them, it is an axiomatic truth that carbon dioxide emissions pose a grave threat to the environment, even though the putative causal chain is filled with missing links. The current practice is to assume that every adverse climate event is somehow the result of the rather smallish increases in carbon dioxide levels over the past 65 years. … Climate variability has been a constant long before human beings inhabited this earth. Of course, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that can trap energy. But so is water vapor, and its levels are far harder to track because its amount and distribution are not constant across the earth’s surface. Most crucially, observed cyclical patterns of temperature change do not correlate with slow but steady increases in carbon dioxide. Recent work by climate scientists Richard Lindzen and others shows that during the so-called Holocene period (roughly covering the last 11,000 years), there was a negative correlation between temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations—strongly suggesting that carbon dioxide levels cannot be the main driver of temperature changes. It should, therefore, come as no surprise that recent climate models that have predicted sharp temperature increases have consistently run “hot,"
Richard Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/richard-epstein/,"More specifically, the over-hyped climate models have ignored two key constraints that undercut the usual doomsday projections. First, changes in temperature occur much more slowly than changes in carbon dioxide concentration. At the same time, the increase in plant growth on land has vastly outstripped temperature changes, contributing powerfully to the greening of the earth in the last ten years, and suggesting that the social “cost"

On the present state of the evidence, the case for strong restraints on carbon dioxide emissions has not been made. The evidence in favor of the close linkage between carbon dioxide and global warming has not been clearly established and domestic American initiatives are in any even likely to produce no discernible reduction in carbon dioxide levels in the absence of any agreement that binds other nations, especially China and India. …"

Richard Epstein,United States,https://www.desmog.com/richard-epstein/,"My original erroneous estimate of 5,000 dead in the US is a number ten times smaller than I intended to state, and it too could prove somewhat optimistic. But any possible error rate in this revised projection should be kept in perspective. The current U.S. death toll stands at 592 as of noon on March 24, 2020, out of about 47,000 cases.

And what they’re going to then do is to ask the extent to which you can say that certain greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide but methane is also a small player in this game can, by trapping heat inside the earth, change temperatures. And it sounds like a very simple inquiry, but it really isn’t, because the basically the carbon dioxide level that can trap heat might be able to some cloud cover, keep it from coming in from the sun. So you increase heat from one source, you reduce heat from another source. It turns out that carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas. The single most important greenhouse, gas perhaps is water vapor, which is very difficult for anybody to do anything about and it’s going to come in large quantities, regardless of what human beings do.

And on my view, it just makes me I’m sort of a mild skeptic or as somebody called a lukewarmer saying yes, there is probably a weak positive connection between the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the temperature. But the stress would be on the weak and that other factors may well be more important. And so the debate has become enormously intense. And folks like myself are probably a minority, but it’s not a tiny minority. And the recent evidence, it seems to be coming in tends to be more on this lukewarming side than it is on the notion that the heat is going to blow us up. [00:08:40"

And in terms of the current debate, that’s just a wild overstatement. The views are much more nuanced than that. These data are old, they’re unreliable. I would count myself as somebody would say, yes, I think more carbon dioxide or other things being equal will produce some increment in temperature. But that’s not the same thing as saying you’ve got a worldwide crisis on your hands. And so sort of keeping everything in perspective both on the political and the intellectual front is, I think, the thing that you have to do the most.  [00:50:56"

What annoys me though, is this complete obsession with carbon dioxide almost to the exclusion of everything else, the alarmism that comes with it, based on dodgy predictions and science, and somehow this, ‘If you don’t agree with us that CO2  is the great evil, you’re against the planet and you’re a denier’. I mean it’s complete and utter rubbish. Does man have an impact on the world? Well, with a global population of now seven and a half billion compared to two and a half billion when I was born, of course man has an impact. But it’s not just man, and what man does that changes climate or the world: it’s volcanic activity, it’s sun spots, it’s so many other things. So look, I want us to have proper, sensible environmental policies but I think this focus on CO2, and this commitment to effectively tax poor people, to give money to rich people and big corporations whilst China’s gonna ignore it all, is gonna leave us in a very uncompetitive position and it’s very unfair on ordinary people."

To be told that the science is settled [on global warming] is hard to accept. Where I grew up, our back wall joined onto Down House where Charles Darwin wrote [On the Origin of Species] and 150 years on, the science isn’t settled over Darwin and I can tell you science is never settled. It’s odd to focus on carbon dioxide. I’m an environmentalist; I’m against carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide and toxins in our rivers. Yes, I’m all for pollution controls but to obsess with carbon dioxide, which as I understand it, is a perfectly natural occurring phenomenon, strikes me as strange."

During the Soviet Communist era in Russia, under Stalin in the 1930s, the government promoted a peasant, non-scientist named Trofim Lysenko to be the Director of the Soviet Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Lysenko virulently rejected the rising Mendelian genetics of the time, holding that acquired characteristics of plants, and maybe of animals and even humans, during their lives could be inherited. This fit the reigning Marxist doctrine of the time that human character and traits were malleable, and that the Soviet government was in the process of creating the selfless, modern, new Soviet man, perfectly suited to life under Communism."

And they are getting rich by exploiting the emotions and pocket books of unsuspecting donors who truly care about our environment Decades ago, the spotted owl and the Endangered Species Act were used to shut down much of the U.S. timber industry. Since then we have seen the ESA mis-used to halt beneficial uses of public and private property – even when there was no threat of the species going extinct.

Free Speech in Science Project,United States,https://www.desmog.com/free-speech-science-project/,"he Attorney General of New York has joined with 19 other State Attorneys’ General to launch a Multi-State criminal investigation focusing on whether ExxonMobil, other petroleum and energy companies as well as public policy institutions and scientists are engaged in some kind of racketeering enterprise to mislead the public on climate change. Most recently, as part of that Multi-State investigation, the Competitive Enterprise Institute received a wide ranging subpoena asking for all of its internal communications and external communications, internal documents, basically everything its ever done on climate change over a period of a decade. The prosecutors involved in this case are drawing on precedent of civil RICO claims that were brought against the tobacco industry in the 90’s and 2000’s. But this is very different. The tobacco industry there is arguably an effort to cover up what were very serious harms and defects with its products that that industry knew about. On the other hand, with climate change you’ve got this enormous, very wide ranging, ongoing decades long debate where the answers are still unclear in terms of exactly how it functions, what the different parameters are, the extent to which human anthropogenic emissions are relevant and the extent to which we might see catastrophic impacts or not and the extent to which we ought to respond preemptively in a policy fashion or not. Being targeted for a subpoena, being the subject of a lawsuit, having that cloud of legal uncertainty floating over your head is enough to intimidate and it’s enough to chill very important speech. Simply put, if we’re going to reach the right solutions for climate change, if we’re going to spend the right amount of money, if we’re going to have the right regulations and if we’re going to reach a policy that people agree is a reasonable and correct policy, the way we’re going to get there is by having a free and open and wide ranging debate, we’re not going to get there by artificially shutting down half the debate, by threatening people with criminal sanctions. This isn’t just about climate change, it’s about the way that we formulate public policy and the way that we participate in politics in the United States of America.

While FoS does not do any original scientific research, it draws on the worldwide body of work by scientists in all fields relating to global climate change. It is our opinion that the Sun is the main direct and indirect driver of climate change. Variations in solar activity and cosmic rays correlate to temperature much better than CO2. This may be because an electro-magnetically active sun diverts cosmic rays from hitting the atmosphere. Cosmic rays have been shown experimentally to assist in cloud formation. Fewer cosmic rays result in reduced low cloud cover, which allows more sunlight to warm the Earth’s surface he United Nations – IPCC reports have been misrepresented by the nonscientific IPCC bureaucrats in preparing the Summary-for-Policy-Makers. Recent research casts doubt on historical data used by the IPCC. Urban effects have contaminated surface temperature data. Some measured CO2 levels of the past 180 years appear to be in excess of present levels. Current climate computer models are unsuitable for making reliable climate forecasts mainly because they assume without justification that CO2 is the major driver of climate. The cosmic ray effects on clouds are ignored. The input assumptions are adjusted to make the temperature projections match recent temperature trends, thereby grossly exaggerating the effects of CO2 on the climate.

David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"You will be forced to buy ineffective boilers and expensive electric cars. That’s why you’re made to pay for windmills, a technology that was cutting-edge just after the Norman Conquest."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"Instead of focusing on technological solutions that enable us to master our environment and get more energy in a more carbon-efficient way – nuclear, CCS, fracking, one-day fusion – we have focused on managing demand so we can use medieval technology like wind power."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"As a country, we’re [responsible for] about two per cent of global emissions. We could shut down the British economy tomorrow and it would make no difference to the nature of the problem […] It makes no sense in a world that’s got more dangerous."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"We must welcome the Government’s seeming willingness to push gently against the net zero ideology, for example with the proposed Cumbrian coal mine, [and] the opening of new areas for exploration in the North Sea."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,In Britain we will soon be making people buy inferior and more expensive boiler technology and driving many out of the new car market if they aren’t prepared to take a punt on electric vehicles.
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"We should keep underlining that there is not just a problem, there is a solution. That is gas to nuclear, backed with investment in fundamental research, and taking advantage of technological advances […] we may therefore need to be more dismissive of current renewable technology as an unnecessary complication."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,We are replacing a lot of perfectly good ways of generating electricity with gas and nuclear ways of generating it with wind and solar.
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"I actually think climate policy, in the way we’ve got it, is a big part of the problem: the constant hectoring of people to change their lifestyles and live in a particular way. The idea that the net zero target can only be reached through very strong state intervention to reach particular goals and that the market won’t do the job, the market is part of the problem."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"Obviously CO2 in the atmosphere has an impact on global temperature. The question is how much, how quickly, whether the feedback loops are quite what people say they are. […] I think probably decarbonisation over time is worth doing for all kinds of reasons, but I’m not convinced that it’s essential at the expense of all other goals to reach net zero in 2050, and you know of course it’s only Europe and the US that has set that goal, other countries around the world have set more relaxed goals than that."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"I think if it can’t be done with technology, the only route, if you’re insistent on the goals, is rationing and demand control and I think we risk going down that road. In fact we already see some signs of it. I don’t think people will want to do that. And so we’re heading for a crunch and a crisis."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"National conservatism is not the whole story. But it can be an important part of conservatism for post-Brexit Britain – helping us govern our nation in a tried and tested conservative way. The Conservative Party should embrace it, and draw strength from it, not push it aside."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"As the realities of Net Zero – sky-high energy prices, the end of flying and red meat – hit home for the general public, the backlash is building and the tide is turning."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"For too long the costs of Net Zero policies have not been given adequate attention by policy makers or the media. There is far too much wishful thinking about pressing ahead with decarbonisation as quickly as possible, and too much demonisation of those who are asking legitimate questions."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,"If our economy is to boom after Brexit, British industry needs a competitive and reliable source of energy which we hold in our own hands and brings investment into this country. Shale gas production achieves all this and more."
David Frost,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/david-frost/,I hope we can get back on track soon and not be tempted by the kind of coercive measures we have seen elsewhere.

Expect more of the same in 2013,"
FTI Consulting,United States,https://www.desmog.com/fti-consulting/,"In order to successfully fend off an environmental activist threat, a company must convince the investment community, and potentially the business media, that the resolution advocated by any activist is not in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders.

That is FAR DIFFERENT from what alarmists have predicted. Their Climate Models are great failures he bottom line is that Catastrophic Global Warming is BS (Bad Science)."
Gordon Fulks,United States,https://www.desmog.com/gordon-fulks/,"The many objections from real scientists will be countered with fictitious claims of ‘consensus.’ (Should that, too, be questioned — based on studies that show widely divergent scientific opinions — the political formula calls for stonewalling.)

Jason Funes,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jason-funes/,"ason Funes: [00:00:17] I have a few messages I want to convey to you all on behalf of the administration and Secretary Zinke. [00:00:23 ason Funes: [00:00:24] First off, it sounds a little redundant, but these are the type of things that I think are strikingly important that we just remember when we’re talking about oil, gas and coal here in the United States. You know, for all those people who, like, turning the lights on at night or opening their fridge in the morning to get their kids something to eat in the morning, you love fossil fuels. For all those people who enjoy using air conditioning. Cooler homes in the summer, turn on their heat during the winter. Stay warm. You love fossil fuels. For all those people who like to drive their cars instead of walk or for those people who prefer to fly instead of taking a horse and carriage long distance, you love fossil fuels. And for those who take leftovers home in a Styrofoam container from your local restaurant, use plastic straws or drink out of your favorite beverage, except for California, you love fossil fuels. So despite what the anti fossil fuel hypocrites say, the everyday American in this country loves fossil fuels. [00:01:24 ason Funes: [00:01:25] So I want to preface this with saying that the previous administration’s war on fossil fuels was more than just mere hyperbole. At the Department of Interior, we are the second largest revenue generator into the Treasury second only to the Department of Internal Revenue Services. And 2008, the Department of Interior off of royalties on fossil fuels onshore and offshore energy production and hard rock minerals collected 24 billion dollars into the U.S. Treasury in 2008. he last year, the previous administration, that number reduced down to five point nine billion dollars, a significant significant reduction and as Fred mentioned, that the shale revolution and hydraulic fracturing and horizontal, drilling, it couldn’t really stop the federal government from increasing its revenues and production here in the country. But let me give you a dollars and cents description of how we increased revenues at the interior and slowly as a stranglehold of the previous administration’s regulations and the burdensome business practices that the federal government was involved with the private sector just kind of took a stranglehold down on everything. So in 2010 was about nine billion and increased all the way up to 13 billion in 2013 until the federal government realized we need to regulate the heck out of them because we’re anti fossil fuels. The war on fossil fuels was a reality. And then again, it came down all the way to, again, five point five billion dollars in 2016. [00:03:04 ason Funes: [00:03:06] Let me give you paint a picture on offshore royalties. So in 2012, we’re producing generating an income of about eight billion dollars of offshore royalties alone. And 2016, that reduced down to 2.8 billion dollars. Again, a burdensome regulatory agenda that the previous administration imposed on the private sector hindered the energy production here in America and ultimately affected everybody. [00:03:35 ason Funes: [00:04:49] So with that, I do want to tell you some good news about all this. Donald Trump is president of the United States, right? Under President Trump and Secretary Zinke, the literal war on American fossil fuels is now over and becoming energy dominant is a true reality of today [00:05:12 ason Funes: [00:14:08] President Donald Trump is not only a builder, he’s a preservationist and he’s a conservationist. And through oil and gas production here in the United States of America, we’re going to get back to building the bridges, the roads, the facilities that our national parks that all Americans are going to be able to enjoy.

GB News,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/gb-news/,"I’m very much an environmentalist Alex, I have been for 40 years […] I’m all for sensible environmentalism, I can’t abide things like plastics in our seas, pollution in our rivers and I want things done about it and I’m pleased to say that in some cases things have been done. Certainly our rivers are much much better than they were 20, 40 years ago. What annoys me though, is this complete obsession with carbon dioxide almost to the exclusion of everything else, the alarmism that comes with it, based on dodgy predictions and science, and somehow this, ‘If you don’t agree with us that CO2  is the great evil, you’re against the planet and you’re a denier’. I mean it’s complete and utter rubbish. Does man have an impact on the world? Well, with a global population of now seven and a half billion compared to two and a half billion when I was born, of course man has an impact. But it’s not just man, and what man does that changes climate or the world: it’s volcanic activity, it’s sun spots, it’s so many other things. So look, I want us to have proper, sensible environmental policies but I think this focus on CO2, and this commitment to effectively tax poor people, to give money to rich people and big corporations whilst China’s gonna ignore it all, is gonna leave us in a very uncompetitive position and it’s very unfair on ordinary people."

We Look forward to having you join us In Palm Springs, you’ll have the opportunity to join the most strategic market-oriented minds in the business world to advance a plan to defend our free-enterprise system Together, we’ll discuss how to effectively address short-term policy threats in 2013 while building toward free-market gains in 2014 and beyond. As a new participant, you will offer a valuable perspective on this group’s rigorous post-election assessment as well as the strategies presented at the meeting We have developed a program that we believe will not only maximize the value of your two days with us, but also your ability to effectively achieve what we believe to be your policy, political and philanthropic goals. Among other topics, in April, we’ll discuss how to more effectively engage growing demographic groups, such as Hispanic and Latino voters, and how to encourage principled and effective advocates of free enterprise to run for office You’ve likely heard many different takes on the 2012 election. And, as you may know from your experience, this type of analysis is not an end in and of itself. As we would within Koch companies, the post-election analysis must be geared toward productive next seps, particularly focusing on where and how we must innovate to achieve our challenging objectives We’ll be joined by a strong line-up of speakers, including several U.S. governors, senators, members of the U.S. House leadership and top political analysts and commentators. We all look forward d to hearing these leaders’ thoughts on the important issues facing our country, and invite your participation through question and answer sessions You’ll also hear strategies that will be central to these efforts going forward scuh as  – Reaching the right people with the right message. Understanding key customer segments – and more importantly the issues that matter to them – will be crucial to educating and mobilization key constituencies in future educational and political battles  – Hispanic, women and youth engagement. Allies will present an approach to more effectively communicate to these growing demographics, all of which will play a critical role in advancing free enterprise  – Candidate recruitment and training. A plan will be shared to help recruit more principled and effective advocates of free-enterprise ot run for office Of course, these only cover a few of the many topics we’ll discuss in April Your efforts will not only effect positive change today, but for years and decades to come. After all, as you’ll see in April, it’s this group’s long-term focus that keeps us fighting for freedom, prosperity and opportunity – even when times are tough.  look forward to seeing you at April’s meeting.

Robert Giegengack,United States,https://www.desmog.com/robert-giegengack/,": What is your assessment of the threat global warming poses to the environment : There are plenty of environmental problems out there; most of them are the consequence of a lot of people using a lot of energy. Global warming is a symptom of that fundamental problem. It’s one of many symptoms; it’s not the most severe. In terms of its capacity to cause the human species harm, I don’t think it makes it into the top 10 : What problem do you have with Gore’s film he advocates of change are now appealing to fear as brazenly as the proponents of business-as-usual. [The latter] tell us we can’t afford to cut back on our carbon emissions because it would destroy the economy. The other side says the world is going to hell and the polar bears are drowning. Both are extreme positions. Scientists have gotten tied up in this political argument because they were frustrated that the politicians weren’t paying attention to what they said. In order to make the message more apparent to the public, they’re exaggerating the risks. An Inconvenient Truth is a prime example : What are some examples of these misleading statements : He claims that temperature increases solely because more CO2 in the atmosphere traps the sun’s heat. That’s just wrong … It’s a natural interplay. As temperature rises, CO2 rises, and vice versa. Variations in planetary alignment are most likely responsible … When gravitation from other planets’ orbits causes the Earth to move closer to or further from the sun, temperatures increase or decrease. When we find that CO2 levels follow that directly, it’s hard for us to say that CO2 drives temperature. It’s easier to say temperature drives CO2 : What response have you gotten about your thoughts on the film : People appreciated that I was drawing attention to the weaknesses in the film. Al Gore missed out on a really terrific opportunity with his name recognition, his access to these resources, and his pretty good understanding of climate processes. He could have put together a film that would have presented this problem in a rational context, and that would have been an enormous contribution. But he has abandoned the credibility of the scientific establishment. He missed the point in studying the cycles from prior periods, and he missed the point that it is the temperature that controls the CO2. Now, we have probably changed that because of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere, and we know or suspect that because we know we have reversed the flux. That’s probably the most significant finding: that we changed the way those systems operate. (Emphasis added) : So it’s not that Gore is wrong, but that he portrayed the “crisis"
Robert Giegengack,United States,https://www.desmog.com/robert-giegengack/,"Perhaps the most scathing indictment of the ‘more CO2 equals a warmer world’ simplicity comes from Ivy League geologist Dr. Robert Giegengack, the chair of Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania.

If we go on to ask a supplementary question – say, how could carbon dioxide raise temperature when the evidence of the ice cores indicates that temperature has always raised carbon dioxide – we will be given complicated answers, but we still haven’t had an answer to the first question, except for the suggestion that the temperature, despite the observations, really has gone up, but that the extra heat is hiding in the ocean."

Indur M. Goklany,United States,https://www.desmog.com/indur-m-goklany/,"[…] Firstly, the global climate has not been warming as rapidly as projected in the IPCC assessment reports. […]models have been running hotter than reality. But these are the projections that governments have relied on to justify global warming policies, including subsidies for biofuels and renewable energy while increasing the overall cost of energy to the general consumer – costs that disproportionately burden those that are poorer. […] Finally, assessments of climate change impacts usually give short shrift to the potential positive impacts of anthropogenic global warming."
Indur M. Goklany,United States,https://www.desmog.com/indur-m-goklany/,"Climate change is not now—nor is it likely to be for the foreseeable future—the most important environmental problem facing the globe, unless present-day problems such as hunger, water-related diseases, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, and indoor air pollution are reduced drastically. […] Future generations should, moreover, have greater access to human capital and technology to address whatever problems they might face, including climate change. Hence the argument that we should shift resources from dealing with the real and urgent problems confronting present generations to solving potential problems of tomorrow’s wealthier and better positioned generations is unpersuasive at best and verging on immoral at worst."
Indur M. Goklany,United States,https://www.desmog.com/indur-m-goklany/,"Considering that future generations will be far better off than current generations even after accounting for climate change, it would be more equitable for today’s industrialized world to help solve the real problems facing today’s poorer developing world than to mitigate climate change now to help reduce the burden on future populations that would not only be wealthier but also technologically superior."

Over-consumption, pushing fast fashion, ignoring plastic – we cannot liberate ourselves from the role we play in today’s unsustainable ecosystem ou could argue that sustainability gets enough media coverage these days, but how much time have you spent lately discussing COVID-19 with your friends vs. discussing the climate crisis?

The support for Granite Bridge Pipeline makes clear voters are seeing past the rhetoric."
Grow America’s Infrastructure Now (GAIN),United States,https://www.desmog.com/grow-americas-infrastructure-now-gain/,"But perhaps the most obvious measure is to ensure that businesses that are investing aren’t penalized for it. While that may sound like common sense, one of the biggest obstacles in the way of midstream energy development has become courts acting as de facto regulators.

Mandy Gunasekara,United States,https://www.desmog.com/mandy-gunasekara/,"n The Daily Caller, Gunasekara was quoted as saying The United States withdrew because the Paris Accord was simply a bad, ineffective deal. It came with billions of dollars of direct and indirect costs to American taxpayers and the economy, while producing no meaningful impact on the environment or climate. Its range of virtue-signaling policies are designed to make our reliable fossil-based energy more expensive — prohibitively so In their quest to fulfill the Paris Accord and force an arbitrary shift to unreliable, costly energy sources, the Climate Mayors network has shown the United States what our future would be, had the president worked to stay in the agreement What these politicians share — beyond their economically depressing climate policies — is the choice to feel good about the future, while ignoring the harm their policies are causing today. The rest of us? We’re on a path for an even stronger, cleaner and healthier future."

She now works in conservative energy advocacy and is running for a spot on Mississippi’s Public Service Commission ‘He has built up the conservative approach to energy and the environment,’ she said. ‘He’s built up a lot of people who are substantively a part of shaping that now and far into the future, Gunasekara, who worked on Trump administration efforts like exiting the Paris Agreement, repealing the Clean Power Plan and replacing it with the Affordable Clean Energy rule, learned some of her communications strategies from working for Inhofe, who was frequently the target of harsh criticism for climate denial or other actions ‘Sen.

It is the latest product of a politically motivated campaign hatched years ago by politicians, activists, and well-funded foundations that want to demonize and entire industry and paint them as corrupt institutions that have, in their own words, pushed humanity towards climate chaos This hyperbolic rhetoric is dishonest. The purported policies are ineffective and it represents all that is wrong in the mainstream environmental discussion Our energy industry and the men and women who work in it are to be celebrated, not demonized."

They are: (1) a distinct human fingerprint in the atmosphere over the tropics; (2) late 20th century warming was unusual; and (3) climate models predict that human-caused warming would become dangerous to humans in the 21st century. No one, including the National Academy of Sciences, has been able to find the distinct human fingerprint except those who falsely claim such a warming is uniquely human-caused."
Ken Haapala,United States,https://www.desmog.com/ken-haapala/,"Perhaps the most remarkable item in President Trump’s first State of the Union Address and its official rebuttal by Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) was the failure to mention dire global warming/climate change, drastic sea level rise, and the many ills that have been prophesized if we continue to burn hydrocarbons and emit carbon dioxide. Is a new realization occurring that we will not overheat or drown in acidic waters? Probably not. The alarmists will continue to attack President Trump for his climate policies and gently criticize Kennedy for his oversight. After all, decades of propaganda cannot be overcome with a single speech."
Ken Haapala,United States,https://www.desmog.com/ken-haapala/,"Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil over land. When the Keystone XL pipeline was proposed, it made economic sense to build it. Not only was it to be built with private money, it made far more economic sense than many of the so-called ‘shovel ready’ jobs in the ‘stimulus bill’ funded by taxpayers. Whether it still makes economic sense is now up to the developers, not the arbitrary political whims of Washington Stopping the Dakota Access pipeline after 98% of the pipeline was laid down was an example of how the greens infected political decisions in Washington. The pipeline was to be drilled almost 100 feet below the riverbed of the Missouri, not placed on it. But, that made little difference to those stopped it Let’s hope that President Trump’s decisions are a sign of better times to come."

As discussed in the second report, thousands of experiments and observations show that virtually all food crops and green plants thrive better in an atmosphere enriched in carbon dioxide and better resist stress such as draught, or insect attacks. Contrary to EPA claims, Carbon dioxide enrichment, condemned by these regulations, is a benefit to agriculture, humanity, and the planet."

William Happer,United States,https://www.desmog.com/william-happer/,Burning all the economically available fossil fuel is unlikely to increase the current atmospheric CO2 levels by even a factor of 2. This is much less than the levels that the Earth has already tested. And a doubled level of CO2 would get us away from the near-famine levels for plants that have prevailed for the past tens of millions of years.

William Happer,United States,https://www.desmog.com/william-happer/,Policies to slow CO2 emissions are really based on nonsense. We are being led down a false path. To call carbon dioxide a pollutant is really Orwellian. You are calling something a pollutant that we all produce. Where does that lead us eventually?

William Happer,United States,https://www.desmog.com/william-happer/,"97% of scientists have often been wrong on many things. Coal, formed from ancient CO2, is a benefit to the world. Coal is CO2 from ancient atmospheres. We are simply returning CO2 to the atmosphere from which it came when you burn coal. And it’s a good thing since it is at very low levels in the atmosphere. We are in a CO2 famine. It is very, very low. Our breath is not that different from a power plant."
William Happer,United States,https://www.desmog.com/william-happer/,"There have been similar and even larger warmings several times in the 10,000 years since the end of the last ice age. These earlier warmings clearly had nothing to do with the combustion of fossil fuels. The current warming also seems to be due mostly to natural causes, not to increasing levels of carbon dioxide. Over the past ten years there has been no global warming, and in fact a slight cooling.  This is not at all what was predicted by the IPCC models."
William Happer,United States,https://www.desmog.com/william-happer/,"I am not a climatologist, but I don’t think any of the other witnesses are either. I do work in the related field of atomic, molecular and optical physics.

I have published over 200 papers in peer reviewed scientific journals."
William Happer,United States,https://www.desmog.com/william-happer/,I am convinced that the current alarm over carbon dioxide is mistaken … Fears about man-made global warming are unwarranted and are not based on good science.
William Happer,United States,https://www.desmog.com/william-happer/,"We know that carbon dioxide has been a much larger fraction of the earth’s atmosphere than it is today, and the geological record shows that life flourished on land and in the oceans during those times.

Nor will there be one. None of the lurid predictions — dangerously accelerating sea-level rise, increasingly extreme weather, more deadly forest fires, unprecedented warming, etc. — are any more accurate than the fire-and-brimstone sermons used to stoke fanaticism in medieval crusaders,"
William Happer,United States,https://www.desmog.com/william-happer/,"We are here under false pretenses, wasting our time talking about a non-existent climate emergency. And It’s hard to understand how much further the shrillness can go, as this started out as global warming, then it was climate change or global weirding, now it is climate crisis and climate emergency, what next, but stick around, it will happen. I hope sooner or later enough people recognize the phoniness of this bizarre environmental cult and bring it to an end."
William Happer,United States,https://www.desmog.com/william-happer/,"Good news isn’t bad news. […] The evidence for a climate crisis simply doesn’t hold up. And that is not about attacking science, as many people would lead you to believe. It’s performing science, it’s advancing science.

Why did the Heartland Institute become so deeply involved in this one issue? What did you see that others didn’t about the importance of climate change as an issue, and what impact has Heartland’s efforts had? JB: “Well, Heartland started addressing climate actually way back, ah, 1994…1995. We did our first book that had a chapter on climate change in it. We addressed it primarily from an economic perspective, arguing that the cost of reducing emissions was really high compared to the sketchy evidence that we had about the cost of harms and offsetting benefits. Nobody listened to us. We did three, four, or five I thought really good policy studies on this topic looking specifically for example, at a carbon tax on agriculture, and the studies got almost no attention It turns out the reason they got no attention is because people were afraid of catastrophic climate change. When the building is on fire, people don’t argue or negotiate the price of fire extinguishers; they’re all too busy running for the doors, and so we concluded that we had to put the fire out before we can get a reasonable conversation to take place here. We’ve got to address this underlying fear of catastrophic climate change. So we did a deep dive in 2007; we said, where is this fear coming from? Is it based on sound science? Who are the scientists who are in this debate? Do they need our help? Why aren’t they getting a better hearing? And why aren’t Cato, and Heritage, and  AEI, and other think tanks engaged in this part of the debate? And what we learned was that virtually none of the free market think tanks were addressing the science. They weren’t doing that because they felt it wasn’t their job. They’re mostly economists and lawyers and they didn’t want to start getting into the physics of climate change. I respect that. But the result was a gap: there was no free market voice on the climate science debate that was taking place, and that was a critical error on the part of free market activists. Unless we address the science, we are going to lose this debate. So we recruited scientists from all around the country. We ended up producing the series called Climate Change Reconsidered for the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change. We had a tremendous impact. I mean, it’s quite remarkable. That book, that series of books, has been cited over 100 times in peer-reviewed articles. The Chinese Academy of Sciences thought so highly of it that it translated it into Chinese and published a condensed volume of Climate Change Reconsidered."
Heartland Institute,United States,https://www.desmog.com/heartland-institute/,"We, I think we’re responsible—one of two or three groups that could genuinely claim responsibility for defeating cap and trade and carbon tax proposals at the national level for a ten year period, pretty much from 2007 until today.  think we’re the reason President Trump discovered, or concluded that climate change is not a real problem and not a crisis facing the country, and that by running on that—by defending coal miners for example—he could appeal to a very big base in the United States. People who expected all along that global warming was junk science, that they would rather have good jobs and inexpensive energy than pursue some liberal dream of, you know, replacing all fossil fuel with wind and solar power."
Heartland Institute,United States,https://www.desmog.com/heartland-institute/,"So Trump ran on that. He won, and it’s been remarkable: for the last year, he’s been implementing many of the promises that he made as a candidate."
Heartland Institute,United States,https://www.desmog.com/heartland-institute/,"Now Donald Trump wasn’t the first choice for most of us. He might not even have been the final choice, but the alternative was truly scary. You know, Hillary Clinton was committed to finishing what Barack Obama started, and that was pretty much destroying the local decentralized education system in America—replacing it with a centralized curriculum. Destroying the decentralized health care system that used to depend primarily on private insurance companies and doctors in private practice. So replacing that with Obamacare, destroying the financial sector I mean all the commanding heights of a free society, President Obama targeted and did major damage for eight years, and for whatever reasons Congress and the courts didn’t seem able to stop him. Hillary Clinton was committed to waging that war for another four years. I’m not sure we could have recovered from that. So we got a second chance at freedom with the election of Donald Trump. Incidentally I decided to step down, now, before the election of Donald Trump, so if anyone is wondering if that influenced my decision it didn’t. But it was a second chance we probably didn’t deserve to preserve freedom in America. It’s very precarious. It is perched on an edge. And so I’m very anxious about the future of freedom,"
Heartland Institute,United States,https://www.desmog.com/heartland-institute/,"What will Heartland Institute’s role be in that? I am optimistic. I think Heartland is going to grow. There’s a much bigger niche for what we do than what I was able to raise money for to fill. You know, I raised about six million dollars a year for the Heartland Institute. We should be at eight or ten [million]. We should have twenty, twenty five guys working in our, just in our government relations office, working with state legislators, giving them the information that they need, testifying when they need testimony, helping them draft legislation. I mean, this is all exciting stuff that they’re asking us to do and we don’t have the staff to do it. o I think under Tim Huelskamp’s leadership we’re going to raise that money. We’re going to expand the staff and fill that niche. So Heartland should be doing well in future years.

The false claim by the Heartland Institute was made public without any knowledge of the translator group. Since there is absolutely no ground for the so called  CAS endorsement of the report, and the actions by the Heartland Institute went way beyond acceptable academic integrity, we have requested by email to the president of the Heartland Institute that the false news on its website to be removed e also requested that the Institute issue a public apology to  CAS for the misleading statement on the  CAS endorsement.

Determination of government policy and the conditioning of public attitudes toward science, says Salomon, the editor of the French science journal Projections, must not be entrusted to ‘a few freaks pretending that things don’t exist.’ Salomon cites radical proponents of animal rights as examples of those holding impractical and unproductive ideas; he objects to their belief that ‘a human being should be treated like any worm, elephant, or flower… that they are all equal.’ He singles out a prominent environmental organization, the Sierra Club; as an example of a group harboring an irrational ideology.‘The Sierra Club believes a contract exists between nature and man…but nature doesn’t speak, so they are the self-proclaimed speakers for nature, which is a very dangerous tendency.’ Calling for rationality, Salomon says of the Heidelberg Appeal: ‘What we are saying is that damage [to the environment] caused by science can be cured by more science and not by less science.’"

These are 1) That the official policy consensus, as widely interpreted today by governments and international agencies, mirrors prevailing scientific opinion and goes no further than it would warrant 2) That prevailing scientific opinion must now be viewed as no longer open to serious question 3) That the process of review and inquiry from which prevailing scientific opinion has emerged, and in particular the IPCC process as its leading element, are professionally above reproach ll these beliefs are unfounded.

Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,A weak short-term correlation between CO2 and temperature proves nothing about causation. Strong negative climatic feedbacks prohibit catastrophic warming. Growth-enhancing effects of CO2 create an impetus for cooling. There is no evidence for warming-induced increases in extreme weather. Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 are a boon to the biosphere.
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"The reality is that any efforts to restrict CO2 emissions will not only raise food prices, but jeopardize the future food security of the planet."
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"Today’s action by Pruitt is a wake-up call for those who continue to falsely claim carbon dioxide is a pollutant. It isn’t, so get over it! Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is essential for life on Earth. It will never cause the dangerous global warming that climate alarmists and their failed models predict. Future legal challenges to reverse Pruitt’s action are welcomed, as they will only fail in the end."
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"For years, the U.S. government has held the position that atmospheric CO2 is a dangerous air pollutant that must be regulated to avoid the perils of global warming and climate change. I hope and trust that you also know that the scientific evidence supporting that position is tenuous at best and upheld primarily by inadequate and unvalidated computer model projections as opposed to real-world observations. This I know from having studied thousands of scientific papers on the topic."
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"Forecasts of future pH come from unproven, theoretical postulations by models based on absorption of CO2 by the oceans. Regardless, there really is no such thing as a representative pH for the whole ocean. It varies vastly near the coast and in upwelling regions, much more than the projected increase in acidity."
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"Despite a constant barrage of stories portraying rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) as a danger and threat to the planet, more and more scientific evidence is accruing showing that the opposite is true."
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"Carbon dioxide is a well-known aerial fertilizer, and many thousands of studies have proven the growth-enhancing, water-saving and stress-alleviating benefits it provides for plants. The reality is that rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are providing a multitude of benefits to the biosphere."
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"Indeed, even now, we may already be unknowing participants in the great plan, as our burning of fossil fuels releases long-sequestered carbon to the atmosphere, awakening earth’s plant life from the lethargy of the low CO2 concentrations under which it has basically slumbered throughout the entire history of man. Let us deeply consider these matters—even prayerfully—before we put forth our arm to steady the ark of God. He is clearly capable of doing His own work."
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,CO2 is not a pollutant. It is a benefit. It is the very elixer of life.
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"As just one example, and a damning one at that, all of the computer models upon which this vision is based failed to predict the current plateau in global temperature that has continued for nearly two decades now. That the Earth has not warmed significantly during this period, despite an 8 percent increase in atmospheric CO2, is a major indictment of the models’ credibility in predicting future climate, as well as the assertion that debate on this topic is ‘settled.’"
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"Despite thousands of scientific articles affirming numerous benefits of rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2, IPCC makes almost no mention of any positive externalities resulting from such…Climate Change Reconsidered II corrects this failure, presenting an analysis of thousands of neglected research studies IPCC has downplayed or ignored in its reports so that scientists, politicians, educators, and the general public can be better informed and make decisions about the potential impacts of CO2-induced climate change."
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"he Industrial Revolution has been a tremendous boon to humanity, as it has lifted large numbers of our kind from poverty to prosperity.  It has also helped the rest of the biosphere – and thereby us once again – via the powerful aerial fertilization effect of the carbon dioxide that has gone into the atmosphere as a consequence of the burning of fossil fuels.  Indeed, it’s been win, win, win for all of life; and if there’s ever been a recipe for success, this is it."
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"In 1992, CEED was formed to meet the challenge to coal plants due to coal combustion and its CO2 profile and engage at the state level."
Craig Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/craig-idso/,"Once filed at EPA, ‘Saving US Coal’ will engage virtually at the state level with regulators directly and through NARUC to educate on the benefits of CO2 to the biosphere and the human environment. At the same time Craig will develop additional, original research showing the truth of CO2 which will be distributed as generated to the regulators. By doing so, coal suppliers can then engage directly with the regulators with challenges to the announced closures; rep-opening previous announcements where the plants are still operating is not out of the question."

Neither are there any real world data that confirm that floods, droughts, wildfires, or hurricanes are becoming either more frequent or more severe as a result of global warming. Nor is there any indication that the total mass of earth’s polar ice sheets is on the verge of declining any faster than the proverbial snail’s pace at which it has done so in the recent past. Nor is there any reason to believe that sea levels are about to rise precipitously and inundate the world’s coastal lowlands."

The aerial fertilization effect of atmospheric CO2 enrichment is the only aspect of global environmental change about which we can be certain; and to restrict CO2 emissions is to assuredly deny the biosphere the many benefits that accrue from this phenomenon."
Keith Idso,United States,https://www.desmog.com/keith-idso/,"There are many direct biological benefits that result from higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Two of the most important are increased plant photosynthesis and water-use efficiency. There appears to be a lot of confusion about the biological benefits of elevated CO2 because the popular media typically fails to report them. Doomsday scenarios of global warming are much more dramatic than the good news of global greening. With this information, in light of the increasing human demands on vegetation, it is my personal opinion that capping CO2 emissions or reducing them to some prior level would be akin to ‘biting the hand that feeds us.’"

They should ask themselves, if this is true, doesn’t it suggest that the modern warming trend may be natural, not caused by man There are also questions about the data used for global warming models. Much of the original temperature data used to justify claims of unprecedented warming has been destroyed or lost.

It’s no wonder Americans will never support this deal, especially when our president promises unrealistic and economically harmful emission reductions of up to 28 percent that will send more jobs overseas and reduce our global competitiveness in the marketplace. This latest announcement is the president attempting to once again give the international community the appearance that he can go around Congress in order to achieve his unpopular and widely rejected climate agenda for his legacy. The Senate does not support the Paris Agreement, which is why his administration prefers to not call it a treaty, and the centerpiece of the president’s emission reduction commitments, the Clean Power Plan, is on shaky legal ground, which the United States Supreme Court recently affirmed. Furthermore, environmental groups and industry agree that the U.S. commitments made under the Paris Agreement cannot be met with regulations and would require legislation from Congress that will never pass."

Jeff Jacoby,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jeff-jacoby/,"[Scott] Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed ‘very challenging.’ The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering,"
Jeff Jacoby,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jeff-jacoby/,"But while climate change brings negatives, it brings positives, too,"
Jeff Jacoby,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jeff-jacoby/,"Alarmists mindlessly condemn atmospheric CO2 as ‘carbon pollution,’ but carbon dioxide is essential to the health and growth of plant life."
Jeff Jacoby,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jeff-jacoby/,"Bottom line? Global warming will bring gains as well as losses, upsides no less than downsides. Climate science isn’t a good-and-evil morality tale. Climate discourse shouldn’t be either,"
Jeff Jacoby,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jeff-jacoby/,"Ours is a much safer, richer, cleaner, healthier planet than it would ever have been without fossil fuels. Break up with the industry that makes our energy so abundant? Sending a valentine would make more sense,"
Jeff Jacoby,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jeff-jacoby/,"In truth, global-warming alarmism is not science at all – not in the way that electromagnetic radiation or the laws of planetary motion or molecular biology is science. Catastrophic climate change is an interpretation of certain scientific data, an interpretation based on theories about the causes and effects of growing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,"
Jeff Jacoby,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jeff-jacoby/,"Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s ‘primary control knob’ — was entirely sound,"
Jeff Jacoby,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jeff-jacoby/,"Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., 1/2 x 1/2. Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8. Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism."

Jeff Jacoby,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jeff-jacoby/,"If Jacoby is going to keep at this topic, he needs to do so in a serious manner, not by citing the rare outlier. He needs to change course and stop citing evidence based on conflicting opinions.

James Madison Institute,United States,https://www.desmog.com/james-madison-institute/,"Should Florida’s government force the premature abandonment of cost-efficient energy sources, such as oil and natural gas, in favor of less-efficient energy sources like wind turbines and solar panels, the resultant spike in energy prices would be likely to cost far more jobs than the so-called ‘green economy’ would create. Therefore, in any calculations of the economic costs and benefits, the economic benefits from, say, allowing more drilling for oil and gas in the Gulf far outweigh the fanciful estimates of the benefits from ‘green’ jobs such as installing solar panels or removing the dead birds and bats killed by wind turbines."

Today, there are many scientists who know that the carbon dioxide alarmism preached by the IPCC and the Stockholm Resilience Centre is based on scientific falsehoods revealed partly by Climategate.

Boris Johnson,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/boris-johnson/,We continue to lobby the U.S. at all levels to continue to take climate change extremely seriously.
Boris Johnson,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/boris-johnson/,"In the view of Piers and his colleagues at WeatherAction, it is all about sun spots, and he is on record as believing that we are now due for a new ‘Maunder Minimum’ – like the famous cold spell in the 17th century, when the Thames froze several times,"
Boris Johnson,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/boris-johnson/,"I am speaking only as a layman who observes that there is plenty of snow in our winters these days, and who wonders whether it might be time for government to start taking seriously the possibility — however remote — that [Piers] Corbyn is right,"
Boris Johnson,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/boris-johnson/,"It is fantastic news that the world has agreed to cut pollution and help people save money, but I am sure that those global leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity; and that fear – as far as I understand the science – is equally without foundation. There may be all kinds of reasons why I was sweating at ping-pong [in December] – but they don’t include global warming."
Boris Johnson,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/boris-johnson/,"As a species, we human beings have become so blind with conceit and self-love that we genuinely believe that the fate of the planet is in our hands — when the reality is that everything, or almost everything, depends on the behaviour and caprice of the gigantic thermonuclear fireball around which we revolve. I am all for theories about climate change, and would not for a moment dispute the wisdom or good intentions of the vast majority of scientists. But I am also an empiricist; and I observe that something appears to be up with our winter weather, and to call it “warming"
Boris Johnson,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/boris-johnson/,"I have not a clue whether his methods are sound or not. But when so many of his forecasts seem to come true, and when he seems to be so consistently ahead of the Met Office, I feel I want to know more. Piers Corbyn believes that the last three winters could be the harbinger of a mini ice age that could be upon us by 2035, and that it could start to be colder than at any time in the last 200 years. He goes on to speculate that a genuine ice age might then settle in, since an ice age is now cyclically overdue,"
Drew Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/drew-johnson/,"In fact, researchers have never established a connection between climate change and extreme weather events. … There’s good reason to be suspicious about green activists’ motives for inventing correlations between climate change and extreme weather. Some, through a winding and sometimes opaque money trail, are financed by Russian authorities interested in undercutting American energy. … The next time green extremists exploit a tragedy by conjuring up a scientifically dubious link between climate change and a severe weather event, consider their motives. All too often leading environmental groups are promoting junk science that undercuts American interests in exchange for a payday linked to nefarious front groups and despicable dictators."
Drew Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/drew-johnson/,"More and more, the leaders of the environmental movement — the ‘Kings of Green’ — are emerging as a pathetic mix of liars, frauds, hucksters, and hypocrites who are more concerned with lining their pockets off environmental hysteria than actually protecting Mother Nature."
Drew Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/drew-johnson/,"Schemes and fibs by environmental extremists like Al Gore, Tom Steyer, and leaders at Google are killing jobs, increasing the price of energy, devouring tax dollars, and threatening America’s energy independence — all in an effort to make a quick buck. … Despite his hypocrisy and poor record of environmental fortunetelling, Gore continues to push for a carbon tax, a sinister scheme that would cost tens of thousands of American jobs and squeeze the poorest Americans most as a result of price hikes to most every good and service imaginable."
Drew Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/drew-johnson/,"If the Earth’s temperature is changing in unnatural and unusual ways, and those climate oddities are, in part, a result of human activity, would taking radical steps that result in demolishing the economy of the developed world and the loss of millions of human lives in developing nations be worth reducing the Earth’s temperature a fraction of a degree? Most reasonable people would say no. Given the exaggerations of the problems and the dangers of the policy remedies, it is clear that government solutions to climate change are a medicine far worse than the illness."
Drew Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/drew-johnson/,The Green New Deal isn’t a serious proposal. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind have their place. But eliminating fossil fuels wholesale would prove prohibitively expensive.
Drew Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/drew-johnson/,An all-renewable future simply isn’t realistic in our lifetimes. A lower-emissions future is—thanks largely to natural gas.
Drew Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/drew-johnson/,"It’s time to phase out these unjustifiable tax breaks for the wealthy. … Any CO2 emissions reduction, no matter how small, is welcome. But there are better ways to ‘go green’ than funding shiny new toys for America’s upper class."
Drew Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/drew-johnson/,"The Green New Deal is laughably unrealistic. If lawmakers implemented even a tenth of the plan, it would destroy the U.S. economy and impoverish tens of millions of people,"
Drew Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/drew-johnson/,"A world with no tobacco might sound appealing to nanny state bureaucrats at the WHO, but it sounds like hell to millions of thriving farmers like Davison Tolopo and his family,"
Drew Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/drew-johnson/,The influence of Russian propaganda and the influx of money funneled from the Kremlin to many of America’s most extreme environmental outfits helps explain why anti-fracking attacks continue even though science has confirmed fracking poses no threat to public health.
Drew Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/drew-johnson/,"Ozone is a naturally occurring gas that helps shield the Earth from the sun’s rays. But when ozone interacts with emissions from industrial factories, cars and electric utilities, it can cause serious health issues ortunately, those health issues are not a real concern these days. Air quality in America is the best it has been in decades. That’s what makes the EPA’s destructive new ozone regulations so senseless."
Mike Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/mike-johnson/,"Founded by some 30 leaders of the Christian Right, the Alliance Defending Freedom is a legal advocacy and training group that has supported the recriminalization of sexual acts between consenting LGBTQ adults in the U.S. and criminalization abroad; has defended state-sanctioned sterilization of trans people abroad; has contended that LGBTQ people are more likely to engage in pedophilia; and claims that a ‘homosexual agenda’ will destroy Christianity and society.

It was meant to prohibit the government from encroaching upon religion."
Mike Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/mike-johnson/,"We don’t have able bodied workers, enough of them in the economy to support our programs. Social Security and Medicare, for example. They’re all scheduled to go bankrupt in less than ten years, some of them. But why? Because we don’t have enough people paying into the system to support those programs. And why is that? Because 63 million of them were aborted,"
Mike Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/mike-johnson/,"Today is an historic and joyful day. After nearly a half century, the Supreme Court has finally corrected its egregious error and returned the fateful policy decision over legalized abortion to the people and their elected representatives—where it has always belonged. No real ‘constitutional right’ to abortion ever existed. The Court invented it out of thin air. House Republicans will continue to stand for the sanctity of human life and hold the Biden Administration accountable for any future attempt to impede the policy decisions of pro-life states."
Mike Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/mike-johnson/,"The reason that I and so many of my colleagues voted to sustain objections that were submitted over the electors submitted by two of those states, Arizona and Pennsylvania, is very simple.

Mike Johnson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/mike-johnson/,"‘What is a woman?’ We’ve all seen the cultural war on women escalate alarmingly in recent days. Judges can’t define what a woman is. Sports teams allow men on women’s teams because they refuse to acknowledge even the most basic differences between men and women. Terminology that was once exclusive to women is now inclusive (e.g., pregnant people). Men pretending to be women receive courage awards on special days designed to honor women. The privacy of women’s restrooms and locker rooms is violated in the name of gender neutrality. The message is clear: embrace gender inclusivity and erase gender distinctives or else Yet this is contrary to the good Creator’s design for men and women. God created male and female in his image to display his glory in unique ways (Genesis 1:27). There are two separate genders—designated in the DNA as either male or female from the moment of fertilization—with distinct characteristics, roles, and responsibilities. As Christian women, we need to give practical, biblically sound answers to a culture that is quickly erasing what it means to be a woman … At Answers for Women 2024, you’ll learn how to reclaim God’s good design for women and overcome the war on women that threatens to overtake us. Engaging, passionate speakers who love God and his Word will equip you with biblical and practical answers to live confidently and courageously as women.

And you need to find out and you need to get onto your local authority representatives, your local councillors, etc. and you need to say to them, that if they belong to ICLEI, you will vote for whichever party says that it will leave that organization and have nothing to do with Agenda 21. You have to get Agenda 21 onto the agenda of local elections and make it clear that any candidate who support Agenda 21 will not get elected by you.

We’re watching the icecaps break apart, polar bears are being left without ice to walk and feed and live on. And this is affecting people in their lives. Farmers are not planting crops in California this year. That means the food supply is threatened. In fact, what the IPCC found was that poor people around the world are going to be affected first and worst by global warming. That means their lives are at risk.

Roger Pielke Jr.,United States,https://www.desmog.com/roger-pielke-jr/,"The Obama plan for climate policy involves one very good idea – investment in new technologies and infrastructure – and one very bad one: cap-and-trade o understand why cap-and-trade is a bad idea, we need only to look to lessons from Europe’s experiences."
Roger Pielke Jr.,United States,https://www.desmog.com/roger-pielke-jr/,Efforts to slow global warming will have no discernible effect on hurricanes for the foreseeable future. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adequately preparing for future disasters are essentially separate problems.
Roger Pielke Jr.,United States,https://www.desmog.com/roger-pielke-jr/,"We risk bad policy when all choices before us are bad ones. For instance, the Kyoto protocol on climate change has its supporters and opponents, but very few are willing to admit that debate over its implementation has considerably more symbolic value than practical effect. The debate over the war on Iraq may have been similarly misguided as better policy options may have been ignored. In both cases, a commitment to pre-emption enables the politicization of intelligence, which then serves as a constraint on options that may be more effective but, for certain ideologues, politically less desirable re-emption hurts the policy process when it results in a dearth of choice."
Roger Pielke Jr.,United States,https://www.desmog.com/roger-pielke-jr/,"Today we see a subset of scientists trying to use their science to affect political outcomes. The most obvious example is with the Kyoto protocol on global warming, where scientists are arrayed on both sides of the debate. What policy makers need from scientists is not support for or against the protocol, but practical alternatives to deal with climate change. The protocol is more a symbol than an proposal for a real solution."
Roger Pielke Jr.,United States,https://www.desmog.com/roger-pielke-jr/,"Of course, it is quite reasonable to believe, as many climate scientists do, that the record of past temperature increased, combined with knowledge of atmospheric chemistry and physics, foretells a warmer future. But what such scientists do not, and cannot, know is this: what will be the impact of such warming on humans and the environment,and how will those impacts change if we limit emissions? ccording to the authors, “climate policy makers continue to focus on energy policy as the primary means to address future climate impacts. The approach is simply doomed to fail. Why has the idea of adaptation been so neglected in the political and scientific arenas?"
Roger Pielke Jr.,United States,https://www.desmog.com/roger-pielke-jr/,"Predictions of the future can be more dangerous than ignorance, if they induce us to behave in ways that reduce our resilience in the face of inevitable uncertainties and contingencies.

I applied for several of these, and actually interviewed for two of them. I did not make it to the final short list."

It became politically correct to caricature us, who dare to speak about it, as those who are talking about things they do not understand and are not experts on. This criticism is inappropriate.

That is a settled matter: The climate has always changed and always will. […] Nor is the crucial question whether humans are influencing the climate. That is no hoax: There is little doubt in the scientific community that continually growing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, due largely to carbon-dioxide emissions from the conventional use of fossil fuels, are influencing the climate. There is also little doubt that the carbon dioxide will persist in the atmosphere for several centuries. The impact today of human activity appears to be comparable to the intrinsic, natural variability of the climate system itself Rather, the crucial, unsettled scientific question for policy is, ‘How will the climate change over the next century under both natural and human influences?’ … Even though human influences could have serious consequences for the climate, they are physically small in relation to the climate system as a whole. … We often hear that there is a ‘scientific consensus’ about climate change. But as far as the computer models go, there isn’t a useful consensus at the level of detail relevant to assessing human influences. … Policy makers and the public may wish for the comfort of certainty in their climate science.

And there’s so many opportunities and motives to distort what the real science says that that’s why the public dialog often reminds me of what you hear in The Princess Bride, where one character says, you know, you keep using that word, but I don’t think it means what you think it means.

You can do the same for hurricanes. And that’s one that really surprises people. The official reports say there are no human influence. I’m sorry. The right way to say is that there are no detectable long term trends in almost all hurricane properties. [00:10:51"
Steve Koonin,United States,https://www.desmog.com/steve-koonin/,"teve Koonin: [00:12:31] On the other hand, as I mentioned in the book and you quoted when you look at the rate at which Greenland is losing ice, it’s highly variable and it was high in the 30s and then it was going and then it was high again, even as the globe was warming steadily. So there’s very likely a large natural variability in the ice sheets. And you’ve got to take that into account as a scientist, if you’re going to say it’s humans that are causing the recent melting. [00:13:07 teve Koonin: [00:13:25] The other thing to say is that if the ice started to melt, all expectations are it would be quite gradual and we would have plenty of time, even according to the IPCC reports.

It’s been doing that for 15000 years. The real question is whether it’s rising more rapidly in recent decades because of human influence as opposed to its natural rate. And the IPCC, while it talks about how the rate in the last few decades is a lot greater than the average in the 20th century and so on, they entirely do not mention, let alone show, a graph showing you that around 1940 it was rising almost as rapidly as it is today, and then it went through a minimum and now is rising rapidly.

And climate is such a great motivator because it’s diffuse. It’s out there in the future. And to the extent that it involves energy, it touches just about everything that society does.

Steve Koonin,United States,https://www.desmog.com/steve-koonin/,"Koonin mentions that this climate is always changing. This is a standard line in the WSJ because it sounds reasonable at first blush, but of course it conveys a deep falsehood. The fact is that the actual peer-reviewed scientific research shows that (a) the rate of warming over the past century is unprecedented as far back as the 20,000 years paleoclimate scientists are able to extend the record and (b) that warming can ONLY be explained by human influences Indeed, it is the RATE of warming that presents such risk to human civilization and our environment. There is no doubt that there were geological periods that were warmer than today due to long-term changes in greenhouse gas concentrations driven by natural factors like plate tectonics. But consider the early Cretaceous 100 million years ago when CO2 concentrations were even higher than today, and there were dinosaurs roaming the ice-free poles. Over the last 100 million years, nature slowly buried all of that additional CO2 beneath Earth’s surface in the form of fossil fuels. We are now unburying that carbon a *MILLION* times faster than it was buried, leading to unprecedented rates of increase in greenhouse concentrations and resulting climate changes. To claim that this is just part of a natural cycle is to be either deeply naive or disingenuous."
Steve Koonin,United States,https://www.desmog.com/steve-koonin/,"Of the many points to be made, here are a few Koonin’s analysis totally fails to consider the significant risk of very serious impacts on marine life of ocean acidification from the rising CO2 concentration. Impacts are already affecting those growing oysters and other shelled organisms in the Pacific Northwest, and coral atolls around the world are at risk over coming decades—and that is pure chemistry totally independent of climate models Koonin’s point that the climate has changed so much in the past is actually one of the key reasons to be worried about human-induced climate change. Were the past climate stable even as the various natural forcings were changing, then there would be less reason for concern that human-induced forcings could change the climate. But reality is that past natural forcings caused significant changes in the climate—and now human activities are leading to forcings that are comparable to or even larger than natural ones in the past. In addition, the forcings being created will change climate more rapidly than have natural factors, making this unprecedented except for the catastrophic changes that have followed the impacts of large asteroids. Thus, contrary to Koonin’s assertion that past climate change suggests a policy of caution, a more appropriate conclusion would be that insights gained from past climate change should be leading to much more aggressive policy action than is now underway Yes, there is lots more to be learned, but the basic physics of the climate change issue have been clear since the 1960s when the President’s Science Advisory Council sent their report to President Johnson and Congress in 1965. Except for refrigerants of various types, human activities are adding increasing amounts of carbon dioxide (and other substances) to the atmosphere that are amplifying the natural warming effect of these substances in the atmosphere—it is not that we are not familiar with the substances we are adding to the atmosphere and have dealt with for decades. That these gases will cause warming has been recognized since the mid-19th century and adding more will surely cause more warming. Certainly, there are more questions to be investigated and resolved, and they do affect how best to adapt and other policies—but they do not alter at all the fundamental reality that human activities have become the primary driver of changes in climate, overwhelming the cycling changes in solar radiation and being much longer lasting than the occasional volcanic eruptions On sea level rise, Koonin’s comments are again mistaken and misleading. The present rate of sea level rise is well above the rate for the first half of the 20th century. The relatively stable climate that has allowed civilization to expand over the last several thousand years has kept sea level quite constant—you can still visit the coast of Sicily and find the remains of salt flats constructed in ancient times. That climate change can cause sea level to change is a key lesson from past changes in the climate that Koonin fails to mention. Since the peak of the last glacial cycle, sea level rose about 20 meters for each one degree Celsius increase in global average temperature (equivalent to a sea level rise of about 30 feet per degree Fahrenheit!!) While it took centuries or more for the full effect to be felt in the past when natural forcings were changing slowly, the adjustment will likely be much more rapid with the faster increase in forcing due to human activities. While the rate of rise will likely decrease slowly with warming because there is less ice on land to be melted, there are still about 75 meters (near 250 feet) of potential sea level rise in the ice tied up in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which have been experiencing accelerated loss of mass."

There are two simple solutions if we are only willing to consider them rationally. First, engineers have shown that it is possible to remove CO2 from the atmosphere by direct air capture, and then store it. Initially, the cost will be expensive, but nothing even close to what the coronavirus will cost. Further, while the technology develops, we can wait to see how fast temperatures are rising, and what sorts of damages we might expect Second is an option that would need to be implemented sooner, but would benefit society nonetheless. Working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a group of nuclear engineers at TerraPower has developed a Traveling Wave nuclear Reactor (TWR) that is absolutely safe to use. If significant numbers of TWRs could be built, costs would be competitive with other sources of power generation. Indeed, as my own research (and that of others) has shown, any serious effort to reduce CO2 emissions from the generation of electricity will require a shift toward nuclear energy. If environmentalists oppose nuclear energy, they will have no other way to retain an economic standard of living that is even close to what we enjoy now and, at the same time, reduce CO2 emissions by even half nfortunately, the main obstacle to the avoidance of catastrophes, such as COVID-19, occurs when (1) our focus shifts from immediate, real threats to future questionable ones; and, (2) all current problems are blamed on the questionable future threat. By putting all of our preparedness eggs in the climate-change basket, we are left not only to weather the storms associated with those threats for which we are unprepared. By attributing all our problems to climate change, we also assume there is one single solution to all our problems and that is to stop burning fossil fuels. How naïve have we become?"

And in fact, there are pipeline campaigns all over the world. Many people have seen the news that Norway just announced that they’re no longer going to drill off the Lofoten islands because of concerns about climate change. So we’re in a situation now where some of the world’s largest financial institutions in the world have said that they will no longer fund the expansion of oil and gas, where our oil from Alberta is high cost and it’s high carbon, and it struggling to compete.116“The great oil debate.

So there’s this idea that Vivian’s promoting that somehow it’s our fault environmental groups and indigenous nations who are campaigning against the expansion of oil and gas. We’re doing that because of the rise in the fires and floods and because we think we need to prepare in Canada. So we talk about the money that is used for environmental campaigns and indigenous groups, trying to raise these risks and awareness and call for different policies in Canada.

A doubling of atmospheric CO2 does not produce twice the warming, again something not understood by the public. In fact I understand the relationship is logarithmic, in which case the additional warming effect with increasing concentration tapers off very quickly,"
Lavoisier Group,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/lavoisier-group/,". Climate change is a constant. The Vostok Ice Cores show five brief interglacial periods from 415,000 years ago to the present. The Greenland Ice Cores reveal a Minoan Warm Period 1450–1300 BC, a Roman Warm Period 250–0 BC, the Mediaeval Warm Period 800 1100AD, the Little Ice Age and the late 20th Century Warm Period 1900–2010 AD . Carbon dioxide is necessary for all life on earth and increasing atmospheric concentrations are beneficial to plant growth, particularly in arid conditions. Because the radiation properties of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are already saturated, increasing atmospheric concentrations beyond current levels will have no discernible effect on global temperatures . The twentieth century was almost as warm as the centuries of the Mediaeval Warm Period, an era of great achievement in European civilisation. The recent warm period, 1976–2000, appears to have come to an end and astro-physicists who study sunspot behaviour predict that the next 25–50 years could be a cool period similar to the Dalton Minimum of the 1790s-1820s . The evidence linking anthropogenic (man-made) carbon dioxide emissions and current warming is limited to a correlation which holds only for the period 1976 to 2000. Attempts to construct an holistic theory in which atmospheric carbon dioxide controls the radiation balance of the earth, and thus determines average global temperatures, have failed . The anthropogenists claim that the overwhelming majority of scientists are agreed on the anthropogenic carbon dioxide theory of climate control; that the science is settled and the debate is over; and that scientific sceptics are in the pay of the fossil fuel industries and their arguments are thus fatally compromised. These claims are an expression of hope, not of reality . Anthropogenists such as former US Vice President Al Gore blame anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for high temperatures, droughts, melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels and retreating glaciers, and a decline in the polar bear population. They also blame anthropogenic CO2 for blizzards, unseasonable snow, freezing weather generally and for hurricanes, cyclones and other extreme weather events. There is no evidence at all to justify these assertions . Increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide will have negligible impact on the earth’s radiation balance and will promote plant growth everywhere. There is no need to sequester CO2 in the ground or to subsidise nuclear or other non-carbon based methods of energy production . ‘Tropical’ diseases such as malaria and dengue fever are not related to temperature but to poverty, lack of sanitation and the absence of mosquito control practices . The decarbonisation of the world’s economy would, if attempted, cause huge economic dislocation. Any democratic government which seriously sought to fulfil decarbonisation commitments would lose office. Shutting down coal-fired power stations and replacing them with renewable energy sources such as windmills or solar panels will cause unemployment and economic deprivation"
Lavoisier Group,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/lavoisier-group/,"The Europeans who have championed the Kyoto Protocol and the regime of de-carbonisation which is the essence of the Protocol, together with their supporters in Australia, would have us believe that by reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by an almost imperceptible amount (through the establishment and enforcement of an international treaty), we can influence the world’s climate. This notion is, quite simply, a fantasy,"
Lavoisier Group,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/lavoisier-group/,"But what is noteworthy is that the role of CO2 as essential plant food and fertiliser is never mentioned by the Kyoto protagonists.

Unfortunately, the data and our understanding are insufficient to usefully quantify the climate’s response to human influences. However, even as human influences have quadrupled since 1950, severe weather phenomena and sea level rise show no significant trends attributable to them. Projections of future climate and weather events rely on models demonstrably unfit for the purpose. As a result, rising levels of CO2 do not obviously pose an immediate, let alone imminent, threat to the earth’s climate."

Eleven of the last twelve years are the hottest on record since observations began in the 1850s, and climatologists say that based on what they know about global weather patterns, there is over a 90% likelihood that the increase in temperatures is traceable to human activity. Most of the climate models suggest a continued, gradual rise in surface temperatures and ocean levels, but the public debate seems to be informed by an unspoken fear in some quarters that an invisible threshold will be breached leading to environmental collapse. […] There is only one way left for conservatives to save America from the regulatory morass that global warming remediation will entail. They must develop scientific evidence that the theory has been oversold. The way to do that is to vigorously support programs like NASA’s Earth Observing System and the Air Force-NOAA National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) — a next-generation weather satellite — that can close gaps in our understanding of the climate. There are enough of those gaps today so that truly draconian regulatory regimes can be justified on the basis of what might happen if warming continues. A more refined understanding of global climate patterns will probably undercut the alarmists, but until we orbit better instruments for observing the earth, the sky’s the limit in terms of what regulatory burdens might be imposed.

The Government have embarked on a policy that will result in one of the most expensive programmes since the introduction of the welfare state, without first carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Is that not extraordinary given that when the previous target was raised from 60% to 80%, in the Government’s estimates the cost more than doubled? Going from 80% to 100% will certainly more than double it again The Chancellor believes that it will cost a trillion pounds, which could otherwise be spent on welfare programmes, health and education; the UN climate committee believes it will cost at least twice what the Treasury estimates; and the New Zealand Government have estimated that it will cost five times as much relative to their economy, as has been suggested. Given ​that, is it not irrational to enter this, as any, policy programme without first estimating the costs and calculating the benefits? Why are we doing it?"

Peter Lilley,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/peter-lilley/,"[Scientists] try to change the facts rather than trying to change their theory. […] I feel certain from reading a lot of the emails and the documents that they were adjusting the data, manipulating the data, concealing the doubts they had internally and continuing to express certainty externally. There’s even example of the computer codes that they’ve adjusted to cut off the evidence of the recent period of global cooling. For the last decade, the world hasn’t heated up as their theories suggest it should have done. Indeed, it has cooled slightly …] And likewise they’ve altered the data in the past, or they’ve selected data from the past which has wiped out the evidence of the so-called medieval warming period when the world was probably warmer than it is now, because after all if it was warmer then without us all burning lots of hydrocarbons, it’s suggests that the hydrocarbons aren’t the only things that cause the temperature and the climate to change. I personally—I’m a physicist by training, long ago—accept that doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will produce a modest warming in the climate, but nothing like the alarmist fears which these scientists have been trying to generate or that lie behind the Copenhagen conference."
Peter Lilley,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/peter-lilley/,"My overall position on global warming is that, as a physicist — I studied physics at Cambridge — I am not one of those who deny that carbon dioxide emissions heat the planet. They do have that effect, although there is less certainty about how much the complex feedback effects that climate models seek to replicate may amplify the comparatively modest effect of increasing CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. Nonetheless, in my view it is wise to take measures to prevent and to adapt to global warming, and it is sensible to try to assess the costs and benefits of action and inaction to ensure that we adopt the most cost-effective approach. The simple fact is that, since the beginning of this century, the average global temperature has flatlined; indeed, over the past 18 months it has fallen back, and according to the satellite measurements of temperature, it is now basically back at the level it was in 1979, when such measurements started to be taken."

In 1990 the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said global temperatures would climb more than 3 degrees C by the year 2100 if we didn’t make radical cuts in greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. Now the same group says the earth might only warm 1 degree C. One degree? But the earth was that warm a thousand years ago during the last climactic optimum! So why the alarm? The chief hothouse gas is water vapor-not carbon dioxide or methane. It accounts for over 90% of global heat retention. Currently, human activity puts about 6 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere per year. Non-human activity, mostly volcanoes, accounts for about 200 billion tons. Human activity, then, constitutes 2-3% of carbon dioxide, which itself is less than 10% of the total."

If humans make no attempts whatsoever to adapt—a curious assumption that the report inexplicably relies on almost throughout—the total number of heat-related deaths will rise. But correspondingly, climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.

Africa gets 50 per cent of its energy today from ­renewables — and remains poor. New analysis from the Centre for Global Development shows that, investing in renewables, we can pull one person out of poverty for about $US500. But, using gas electrification, we could quadruple that. By ­focusing on our climate concerns, we deliberately choose to leave more than three out of four people in darkness and poverty. Addressing global warming requires long-term innovation that makes green energy affordable. Until then, wasting enormous sums of money at the expense of the world’s poor is no solution at all."
Bjørn Lomborg,"United States, Denmark",https://www.desmog.com/bjorn-lomborg/,"A new paper by Todd Moss and Ben Leo from the nonprofit think tank, Center for Global Development, puts it very clearly. If Obama spends the next $10 billion on gas electrification, he can help lift 90 million people out of poverty. If he only uses renewables, the same $10 billion can help just 20 million-27 million people. Using renewables, we will deliberately choose to leave more than 60 million people in darkness and poverty…Our development aid should be used to help 60 million more people out of poverty, not as a tool to make us feel virtuous about facile, green choices."
Bjørn Lomborg,"United States, Denmark",https://www.desmog.com/bjorn-lomborg/,"There’s no question that burning fossil fuels is leading to a warmer climate and that addressing this problem is important. But doing so is a question of timing and priority. For many parts of the world, fossil fuels are still vital and will be for the next few decades, because they are the only means to lift people out of the smoke and darkness of energy poverty."
Bjørn Lomborg,"United States, Denmark",https://www.desmog.com/bjorn-lomborg/,":30-10:20 “If you look at the time period from 1900 to 2050, surprisingly, for a lot of people, the net impact of most global warming was actually positive. That’s because CO2 is actually fertilizer, that means it increases our agricultural production. Of course, in the long run increasing temperatures is also going to reduce agricultural production. We will also see more people die from heat, but many more people will avoid to die from cold, again with moderate global warming. We are also seeing the lower costs of heating outweigh the extra costs of cooling. So, actually, if you look at what the cost is [of global warming] it turns out to be a slight negative around 1900 at about 0.5% and across the most of the century, mostly a negative."

Do we want to focus on cutting CO2, at fairly high costs and doing fairly little good a hundred years from now?

Over the past century, deaths have dropped 97%. Heat waves capture the headlines. Globally, however, cold kills nine times more people. Currently, higher temperatures are resulting in 166,000 fewer temperature-related deaths annually Fear-mongering and suppressing inconvenient truths are pushing us dangerously toward the wrong solutions.

I think that in this, Earth and nature as humanity still transcends us, because the idea that we could change the global temperature by one degree, by two degrees, by some regulation, policy measure and change in behavior and consumption is, I think, really bold. If we thought that this could be done by human activity, then imagine that humanity would decide to simply change the climate by two degrees. I don’t think it’s just possible, it’s out of the question. I think this thesis is supported by the existing uncertainty that there are, on the one hand, the studies that you mention and, on the other hand, that there are many studies that question this. I’m not an expert on global temperature. I think it’s hard to measure, but for example, if we look at a more reliable source, and that is the local temperature in Prague’s Klementinum, we can observe the history of two hundred and thirty, or how many years when it is measured, such a ‘U’ shape, the average temperature was sometime around 1800. eleven degrees, then dropped a hundred years later to nine and now rises again to eleven."

We cannot successfully address our climate challenge by eliminating sources of energy that countries are committed to using. Only through innovating and developing new technologies that reduce carbon emissions will we truly make a difference.   Whether it be successfully commercializing emissions-reducing technologies in the power, manufacturing, or transportation sectors, the U.S. must lead the world in innovation.  And we must do so in a way that creates meaningful opportunity for those communities here in the U.S. that have already been left behind instead of punishing them with burdensome mandates.

Joe Manchin,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-manchin/,"00:09:54] Our shared focus on identifying pragmatic solutions to the urgent problem of climate change makes the work of this committee vital to our nation. I believe it sets a model for working together to come to an agreement on a bipartisan path forward in spite of partisan rhetoric. I also want to thank our distinguished panel for joining our committee to share your insights with us today. [00:10:13 [00:10:15] For years I’ve argued and we need to be working from an agreed upon set of facts about the climate crisis in order to move forward quickly with real world solutions that protect our communities and workers from unnecessary economic harm. You really can’t play a game of darts if you can’t agree on what the bullseye is. And that’s what we’re dealing with here. People, I’ve never seen in any one town such as this, people will basically set their opinions and try to try to justify their opinions based on what they want the facts to be, not based on what the facts are and try to work towards an agreed position. [00:10:57 [00:10:58] To that end, we are seeking to use this hearing to identify what emissions reductions the power sector has achieved and what the power sector must do to contribute in near-term and long term emission targets. I believe that the focus must be on the path towards innovative power generation technologies that will keep the lights on, our economies humming and achieve the emission reductions we so desperately need. [00:11:18 [00:11:19] First man made climate change is real and it’s a serious threat to our citizens, to our economy, to our environment and to our national security. In 2016, a devastating flood took the lives of twenty three West Virginians, unparalleled in any other time in history in West Virginia. Over the last four years, I’ve asked the White House for emergency funding six times as a result of severe flooding. My office deploys an emergency response page during severe weather and we have posted it dozens of times over the past few years. [00:11:48 00:11:49] In Alaska, my dear friend and colleague here and Chairwoman Murkowski, there have been four communities who need to immediately pick up and move and 12 more actively planning for a partial or total community relocation due to climate change. As Mr. Schutt will tell you about in his testimony. [00:12:08 00:12:09] Climate impacts have also forced people to leave their communities permanently in the wake of storms like Hurricane Maria, after which nearly 130,000 people left Puerto Rico, according to the Census Bureau. And if you just look on the news today, what happened in the last couple of days as far as horrific tornadoes down in the south and southwest. According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, the U.S. has experienced 44 weather and climate disasters since 2015. The cost has neared 400 billion with a B. 400 billion dollars. [00:12:43 00:12:44] Second, all communities, including those in energy producing states like West Virginia, Alaska, are experiencing the harmful impacts of the climate crisis. These impacts are often felt disproportionately in West Virginia communities which are already suffering from the downturn in coal production, resulting unemployment and negative effects of coal company bankruptcies on retirement and health care benefits. Therefore, the path to a climate solution must offer states like West Virginians opportunities, not additional economic burdens. [00:13:15 [00:13:16] The chairwoman and I share a deep concern for our rural communities and seek to use this committee as a means of identifying and legislating pathways to ensure our constituents have a role in the clean energy future. And third, the solutions must be grounded in reality, which requires a recognition that fossil fuels aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. [00:13:37 [00:13:39] The IEA predicts that up to 51 percent of China’s power could come from fossil fuels in 2040, depending on energy policies that are adopted. That number could be as high as 57 percent for India. This is the real world we’re living in. The role of fossil fuels in the global economy is growing, and the U.S. must lead the world in pursuing the solutions that will allow us to burn fossil fuels in a cleaner, more cost effective and more efficient manner. [00:14:06 [00:14:07] What we were told by Dr. Birol is that the cost of the plants in Asia is about 11 years old for all their fossil fuel. Now 11 years is the average. They’re going to amortize those plants out. They’re going to run until they’re 40 to 50 years of age. That’s just the economic facts. In America we have plants that are much older. It’s much easier for us to convert than it is for Asia. And that’s just the what we’re dealing with today. It does not mean that we should set aside work, increasing efficiency, advancing nuclear storage or renewables such as solar, wind and hydro power. But it does mean that we have to double down innovative solutions for the clean use of fossil energy in the electric, industrial and transportation sectors. And we must do it today. [00:14:50 [00:14:51] Just last week, Dr Birol, the leader of the International Energy Agency, told this committee that the rest of the world, and particularly countries in Asia, will continue to use fossil fuels for decades to come. He stated and I quote, “Last year, global CO2 emissions once again increased and the main driver for that increase came from Asia."

With that said – what is also clear both scientifically and technically is that the EPA’s CPP is not a plan that will significantly impact global CO2 emissions. It’s not an environmental regulation, it is energy regulation.

And our nation has benefited from the vast range of experiments launched by different givers. Unlike elected leaders, donors are not bound by politics. Unlike businesses, they do not have to make money. Their independence has enabled them to support bold, sometimes unconventional, even unpopular initiatives"
Adam Meyerson,United States,https://www.desmog.com/adam-meyerson/,"The opponents of philanthropy contend that donors would do more for humanity if they transferred their assets to government through higher taxes, rather than investing in charitable causes. But if the Julius Rosenwald Fund had been accountable to voters, it would not have been able to finance the construction of 5,000 schools for African-American children in the Jim Crow South. The John M. Olin Foundation would not have been able to help create the Federalist Society.

Conservatives are breaking down barriers to religion in the public square by emphasizing such principles as religious freedom and religious expression. But they haven’t yet found an effective vocabulary for arguing that religion should take a more central place in American life. The next challenge is to encourage greater public appreciation of the role of religion and religious believers in healthy societies while affirming a commitment to the separation of church and state Freedom. Conservatives have won the argument about the importance of private voluntary associations in a free society.

Public policy gives special privileges and protections to marriage because it is the most important institution for the raising of children. Homosexuals are free to form their own lasting unions and to make their own personal commitments to each other, but it trivializes marriage to give such unions the special protections of the law or the subsidies that are intended to help mothers and fathers raise children into upstanding citizens."

Similar hearings also could be held on the bipartisan National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, established recently in response to a challenge from President Clinton with the goal of reducing the teen pregnancy rate by one-third by 2005.

Conservatives think one of our society’s highest priorities must be to provide moral authority to young people.

A. Alan Moghissi,United States,https://www.desmog.com/alan-moghissi/,"How can one convince a poverty-stricken parent whose child is sick or hungry that protecting the environment is important? Destitute people have little or no desire to protect the environment. There is a misconception within the environmentalist community that technologic development and protecting the environment are inherently incompatible. Apparently, many environmentalists neglect (a) the equivalence between poverty and exposure to the most toxic pollutants and (b) poverty’s causal relationship to environmental problems, such as the large-scale destruction of flora and fauna, soil erosion, and water pollution While most industrialized societies have a good understanding of poverty and at least a marginal understanding of ignorance, what constitutes protecting the environment is controversial. In certain countries, advocates of environmental protection call themselves ecologists. One environmentalist slogan is ‘Support your ecology.; Most dictionaries (and the Natural Resources Defense Council) define ‘ecology’ primarily as a branch of science whose focus is the relationship between organisms and their environment. By this definition, an ecologist is a scientist specializing in the study of such relationships. But the cores of most environmental advocacy organizations do not consist of scientists proficient in that field. The philosophy of most environmentalist groups is, in effect, that members of endangered species deserve protection and that, because there are billions of humans, humanity does not qualify for protection In the United States and in nearly all other democracies, environmental laws are established primarily to protect humans. For example, wildlife-preservation laws serve to maintain gene pools, which are potentially useful to human therapeutics. Although every civilized society has accepted avoidance of unnecessary harm to nonhuman animals as an ethical obligation, no society is willing to compare human lives to the lives of other organisms In the next century, poverty, ignorance, and protecting the environment will be the greatest challenges to the world community. Public education with three foci—literacy, the sciences, and critical thinking—is necessary for the elimination of poverty. And the elimination of ignorance and poverty is necessary for efficient protection of the environment. Excessive allocation of resources to deal with one of the three challenges will probably further complicate dealing with the other two."

Human influences on the climate (largely the accumulation of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion) are a physically small (1%) effect on a complex, chaotic, multicomponent and multiscale system. Unfortunately, the data and our understanding are insufficient to usefully quantify the climate’s response to human influences. However, even as human influences have quadrupled since 1950, severe weather phenomena and sea level rise show no significant trends attributable to them. Projections of future climate and weather events rely on models demonstrably unfit for the purpose. As a result, rising levels of CO2 do not obviously pose an immediate, let alone imminent, threat to the earth’s climate."

The climate has been constantly changing since the earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago or example, in just the past 2000 years, we have seen the Roman Warm Period, when it was warmer than today…Then came the cooler Dark Ages… Followed by the Medieval Warm period, when it was at least as warm as today… Then we had the Little Ice Age – that drove the Vikings out of Greenland. And, most recently, a gradual 300-year warming to the present day. That’s a lot of changes. And, of course, not one of them was caused by humans uring the past 400,000 years there have been four major periods of glaciation – meaning that vast sheets of ice covered a good part of the globe – interrupted by brief interglacial periods. We are in one of those periods right now. This is all part of the Pleistocene Ice Age which began in earnest two and a half million years ago. It’s still going on, which means that we are still living in an ice age. That’s the reason there’s so much ice at the poles. Thirty million years ago the earth had no ice on it at all. o, then, what about carbon dioxide, the great villain of the Global Warming alarmists? Where does that fit in to this picture? Not as neatly as you might think emperatures and carbon dioxide levels do not show a strong correlation. In fact, over very long time spans – periods of hundreds of millions of years – they are often completely out of sync with each other. ver and over again, within virtually any time frame, we find the climate changing – for reasons we do not fully understand. But we do know there are many more factors in play than simply the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere – factors such as the shape and size of the earth’s elliptical orbit around the sun, activity from the sun, and the amount of wobble or tilt in the earth’s axis, among many others. Even the relatively short 300-year period from the peak of the Little Ice Age to the present has not been steady. The latest trend has been a warming one, but it began nearly a century before there were significant carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. And, there has been no significant warming trend in the 21st century. Contrary to media headlines, the trend over the past couple of decades has been essentially flat. eanwhile human-caused CO2 emissions are higher than ever. About 25 percent of all the CO2 emissions from human sources have occurred during this period of no net warming o, what are we in for next? Will the temperature resume an upward trend? Will it remain flat for a lengthy period? Or, will it begin to drop? No one knows. Not even the biggest, fastest computers. ll the information I’ve presented – the increases, decreases and plateaus in temperature over the ages and into the last centuries – is available to anyone who wants to seek it out.

Since then, I have watched as hysteria has grown, as if the whole world is going to come to an end and civilization is going to die because of humans causing this climate change. I don’t buy that, and I certainly know we don’t have any proof of it.

The article will address the issues from the viewpoint of the economics and morality of individual choice."
Alan Moran,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/alan-moran/,"Climate alarmists latch onto every climate catastrophe as evidence that mankind is destroying the planet. Even the recent NSW bushfires were attributed to previous emissions of carbon dioxide, with dark mutterings that Tony Abbott would exacerbate matters, in spite of the fact that the most recent IPCC report had been forced to acknowledge that there had been no increases in temperatures or extreme events over the past 10-15 years Even if greenhouse gases were bringing about harmful climate change, there is nothing that Australia can do to mitigate this – 90 per cent of the world emissions are now attributable to nations which will not moderate such activity within their own domestic economies With the carbon tax to be terminated, attention therefore needs to be turned to repealing the renewable requirements."
Alan Moran,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/alan-moran/,"The actual cost, if the global warming were to take place along the lines foreshadowed, would be quite small. It would be like the amount over 100 years less than half a year’s growth in the world economy and even that has got a lot of things in which you’re gilding the lily and would suggest that even that’s a gross exaggeration. So, you know, this is not there’s no catastrophic outcomes likely to emerge from warming, even if it takes place … The point is, who knows, are the temperatures going to go up, down or sideways? Nobody knows. I mean, there is a theory attached to the increase in carbon dioxide that they would go up somewhat a little bit. That theory is not being sustained by the evidence over the past 18 years. It may well be true, the theory. But then again, if it is true, the answer is that there would be a slight increase anyway. It will only be an increase of over one and a half or two degrees centigrade. And that increase will have a trivial cost to the economies of the world. By trying to combat it, as we found out in Australia with, you know, you talked about energy poverty or we’re seeing industries disappearing because the costs have gotten too high, trying to combat it will have a catastrophic effect on the economy."

Alan Moran,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/alan-moran/,"So what is it we know about human induced global warming? The most important emission is carbon dioxide, the atmospheric content of which has varied between 0.15 and 0.3 per cent over the past half million years. It is only harmful to humans or other animals at concentrations of over 10 per cent and life actually evolved when the atmospheric content was about 7 per cent A doubling of carbon dioxide content to about 0.6 per cent is likely over the coming century. Almost all scientists agree that the main direct effect of this is to increase average global temperatures by slightly over 1°C (beyond a doubling of its share, further carbon dioxide increases have a negligible climate effect) Most models estimate that this is compounded by feedbacks bringing 2-4°C temperature increases. But those feedback effects are unproven and their impact may even be negative. This is at the heart of the differences between ‘warmists’ and ‘deniers’ Higher temperatures stemming from carbon dioxide emissions are likely to compound what most scientists speculate is a trend recovery from the cooler climate experienced during the ‘Little Ice Age’ (which ended a century and a half ago) Each summer brings ‘the hottest day ever’ claims for some area. Sometimes we hear ‘the coldest day ever’ claims. And many cite these occurrences and well publicised storms as proof that ‘climate change’ (the new euphemism for ‘global warming’) is taking place. But these extreme weather events turn out to be unexceptional."

Alan Moran,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/alan-moran/,"My own chapter (Alan Moran) sets the context of the debate by examining the costs of taking action (which are considerable and massively understated by the IPCC) and any benefits of doing so (which are slender and overstated by the IPCC),"
Alan Moran,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/alan-moran/,"lan Moran: [00:02:45] So the storyline is that at a price of $50 a tonne of CO2, or perhaps even $100 a tonne of CO2, we can reduce emissions and stabilize companies on a global basis. $50 a tonne, of course, means doubling the cost of electricity, and for it to bring about the abatement requires quite bold assumptions, I think, involving the energy substitutes and supply flexibilities. [00:03:14 00:07:14] all of these estimates are basically done by economists who just take the science as given, and they more or less accept the costs of the doom laden aspects of scientific notions. Thus most of the the public statements and costs of living harp on about things like dengue fever and another long defeated disease that could only show a resurrection, as Jay Lehr said actually, with DDT could only show a resurrection if we decided that we were going to ban DDT as we have, which is allowed to resurrect malaria. And some of the now discredited cost elements that are associated with the intensification of hurricanes or lower production of food in Africa. And even things like the reduction of the the coastal areas, inundation of coastal areas. Even the IPCC has tended to downplay that so much more recent report . So that the cost benefit, the costs of the global warming, you know, relatively even at the most, the subjects are, it would cost the world plus two or minus two point five percent of GDP. [00:08:29 [00:09:08] So what we’re actually talking about is a cost which, even on doom-laden forecasts, is about 2.5 percent of GDP at most, in the context of world GDP growing many, many times more than that, perhaps 900 percent. So, you know, in that sense, the actual cost of that of global warming, even on the adverse assumptions being made is quite trivial. [00:09:37"
Alan Moran,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/alan-moran/,"00:20:20] What we can see is that there will not be a new international carbon tax. Absolutely out of the question. The economics has fallen prey to reality, the costs involved. So it’s now time to take the offensive. And I think we’ve got to think in terms of a variation of the the peace dividend that occurred once the Soviet Union was overturned following the Cold War. That waste that was involved in armaments, et cetera, is similar to the way it’s been accompanied by the great climate scare over the past 15 years. [00:20:52"
Alan Moran,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/alan-moran/,"lan Moran: [00:06:18] “Now we had a bit of a discussion about reducing carbon dioxide emissions by other forms of fuel and of course, there’s absolutely no question about it: wind and and any other, solar is basically in a dead end, at least any technology we can think of. But nuclear isn’t."
Alan Moran,Australia,https://www.desmog.com/alan-moran/,"00:08:05] “This chart, I think, which just happens to be Australia, but other countries are pretty much the same, it really just illustrates the impossibility of meeting the emission reductions by replacing coal with nuclear […] the fact is that electricity is only about 35 percent of the CO2 equivalent emissions. So if you reduce, use it all, we don’t have anything like to the sort of levels we have been talking about to get that world per capita level two and a half tons, which is again is quartering the existing OECD level."

Iain Murray,"United States, United Kingdom",https://www.desmog.com/iain-murray/,"[S]ome Western governments are working to increase energy costs, purportedly to combat global warming What they are really combating is prosperity. … America should free up federal lands to energy development, rather than pickle them in regulatory aspic. Europe could enjoy its own energy boom by approving hydraulic fracturing Reducing artificially high energy costs is the first step in tackling fuel poverty. In America, the market is alleviating the burden of energy costs on poor households, even as the government goes the wrong way. That shows us the way forward for tackling the much greater problem in the developing world."

Iain Murray,"United States, United Kingdom",https://www.desmog.com/iain-murray/,"That is an important consideration in deciding whether the current warming endangers human health and welfare. EPA’s decision to simply ignore it and press forward with its endangerment finding represents a premature rush to judgment. Thus, the finding is a purely political move."

[…] The scientists should retire from the battlefield now. They have picked the wrong fight at the wrong time. Their intervention has done nothing to alter the political landscape except confirm that it is economists, not scientists, who are the most important figures in deciding whether anything will be done now about global warming. The alarmists will fight on, as Lee did after Gettysburg for two more years, but barring unforeseen political events, their war is lost."

If they are melting, whether naturally or for anthropogenic reasons, it would clearly be a good thing if we can harness the freshwater runoff to the general benefit of humanity. However, as should be clear from those figures, it is pretty unlikely that the resource is going to disappear. The scientific evidence suggests that the damn fools are not those supposedly melting the ice, but those who believe every alarmist warning that melting is a serious problem."

For the last two years, two issues have preoccupied climate science––many published papers have devoted consideration to both the pause in the trend in global average temperature, and to climate sensitivity. Both issues are essential: that the global average temperature has not increased in the last 17 years means that hypothesis that increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere increases global average temperatures is incorrect or the climate sensitivity to CO2 is grossly over-estimated.

In fact, I used to argue with some of my colleagues that had some doubts, and they were not scientists but we had some heated arguments, and I would tell them that they are insane to think that thousands of scientists would be wrong and that the IPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports would be wrong. And I was a very strong defender of that. And then the Climategate emails came out and I saw that there was an obvious attempt to hide information, they were not forthcoming, and I got curious about the discrepancies that I started to realize that — at that time I didn’t know what about those at that time, 2010, but I started researching them because I was curious about the science, the physics.

Reducing emissions over a longer time period will be far less harmful to our economic well-being than forcing rapid reductions. I have no doubt that if we tried to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent over the next few years we would bring on a full-scale depression."

Brendan O’Neill,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/brendan-o-neill/,"rendan O’Neill: [00:02:45] What is behind the energy crisis? What is causing this extreme crisis that we are heading into right now lex Epstein: [00:02:54] The direct cause is very, very simple, and the only reason why it’s not being globally publicized is that it implicates our establishment. I’m talking about the deeper cause, but the direct cause is very simple. It’s supply and demand, and for the last fifteen-plus years, the world has been involved in a concerted effort to rapidly restrict the supply of fossil fuels, with the explicit goal of rapidly eliminating them by say 2050, and that involves opposing fossil fuel investment, fossil fuel production, fossil fuel refining, fossil fuel transportation, and so that artificially suppressed the supply of fossil fuels. And the promise was that, ‘oh well, all that demand for energy is no problem, because unreliable solar and wind will more than make up the difference.’ And that failed to materialize, and so what you have is a shortfall of supply relative to demand. nd you really saw the height of this irresponsibility in 2020, when we had lockdowns, and, you know, global pandemic, and there was this idea of, ‘oh, we’ll never really need fossil fuels again, and the industry isn’t doing well, and so, we don’t need to invest in them, and it’s okay to talk about divesting,’ and that never made any sense whatsoever. Again we’re talking about the deeper causes, but t’s just very clear that the establishment is involved in a global anti-fossil fuel movement that radically and artificially restricted the supply of this relative to what it should be, and what it would be had they not restricted it, and then that leads to these terrible consequences. [00:04:35 rendan O’Neill: [00:04:56] There is a clear link about the fact that we have essentially been demonizing energy over the past few decades, seeing energy production and energy consumption as problematic things, destructive things, which create so much pollution, so much waste, so much carbon, and the campaigns which is as you say were embraced by the establishment, the campaigns to limit our use of fossil fuels, limit our capacity to produce the energy we need, the idea that that wouldn’t then give rise to some form of energy crisis, or to a spike in energy prices, or problems with supply and demand, it seems to be a complete fantasy. [00:05:55"
Brendan O’Neill,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/brendan-o-neill/,"Climate policies have been blamed in some quarters for contributing to the recent run-up in energy prices, but there is no evidence. In fact, a greater supply of clean energy sources and technologies would have protected consumers and mitigated some of the upward pressure on fuel prices."
Brendan O’Neill,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/brendan-o-neill/,"lex Epstein: [00:10:00] We need to implicate them over and over and over. It’s not enough to just say once or twice, ‘hey, by the way you had a role.’ It’s not enough. This is your fault, and you are denying responsibility. And I also take the step of, and you could as well, but, ‘I was right about this.’ Like I’ll put out a video and say ‘hey I warned you about this.’ And the reason is, it’s not to aggrandize myself, it’s that, whenever you have a crisis, who’s implicated and who’s vindicated changes the trajectory of the intellectual landscape going forward. We need the right people implicated and the right people vindicated. It happens to be that the anti-fossil fuel side needs to be implicated and the pro-human side, like the two of us, needs to be vindicated."
Brendan O’Neill,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/brendan-o-neill/,"lex Epstein: [00:21:32] Net Zero is such an interesting issue to comment on, because nobody can believe how murderous it is. But, even if you are concerned about climate side effects and warming, it doesn’t change the fact that fossil fuels could have huge, unique benefits, that if we lost, would be absolutely catastrophic, or I’d argue, apocalyptic.

And this is really going to be serious now because, you know, Biden’s legislative agenda for climate is floundering in Congress. It’s probably not going to pass.

One America News Network (OAN),United States,https://www.desmog.com/one-america-news-network-oann/,"aniel Turner: [00:00:50] One of the problems of the Paris Climate Accord is that it sets up these globalist mandates that America has to follow, where many countries, particularly China and Russia, have ignored to follow these mandates. [00:01:03 tephanie Myers: [00:01:59] Biden also signed an executive order revoking the 2019 permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. We already know there’s been repercussions with job losses and even union officials speaking out against the move, but what are some of the other consequences regarding this decision? [00:02:14 aniel Turner: [00:02:16] Yeah, this is really a tragic decision, and I’ve spoken to numerous pipeline workers. I’ve filmed a couple of them for our website. And if you are one of these 11,000 individuals, these last three weeks have been hard. You don’t have a paycheck. You don’t have health care benefits. So there is this tremendous suffering that he inflicted for no reason other than pure politics on these people [00:02:39 ut like the Paris climate accord, there is a national security implication here. What we were doing for years is bringing oil from Canada, a reliable partner at a very good price, bringing their oil down to Texas for refining. Now, without the Keystone Pipeline, Canada is going to look for alternatives. They’ll probably send it west to their own ports and send it to China for refining, something I mentioned earlier. Or they’ll send it outside on the world market. 00:03:13] And so now America is going to forego this constant stream of a reliable resource. And let’s face it, we need oil. We still use oil. And there’s this notion we’re going to get away from oil in the next 50, 100 years is just unscientific, and it’s quite frankly insulting and laughable. [00:03:34"

The climate scare, in other words, is the latest environmental scare that has the same solutions going back 50 years. [00:00:54 arc Morano: [00:01:02] Yes, we have warmed since the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850, but we actually, you know, it’s actually a question of whether we’ve warmed since the nineteen thirties. The hottest days on record, and we show this in the film, for heat waves, still, the nineteen thirties hold the record for city heat waves across the United States, and we actually quote scientists on this and then show the data and the charts. So it goes through swings. We cooled until the 1970s and remember the coming Ice Age scare we had the 1970s, but we’ve definitely warmed since then. Obviously, people care about the environment. Everyone cares about the environment. The difference here is trying to say that we’re facing an emergency based on carbon dioxide emissions, a trace essential gas, and the atmosphere, is where this has gone off the rails.

So what’s happened here is they’re going to try to morph climate and COVID together, and you’re going to go from a COVID lockdown to a climate lockdown.

Ms. Mercer’s family foundation also supports politicians the agitators despise, and organizations or scientists with views contrary to their belief in human-caused, catastrophic global warming The signers of this letter include many scientists, with a deep understanding of climate. The case for harm from catastrophic global warming is growing weaker as more is learned about the Earth’s climate system, and about the poor predictive power of computer climate models. The Earth has supported abundant life many times in the geological past when there were much higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is quite likely that future generations will benefit from the enrichment of Earth’s atmosphere with more carbon dioxide. And there is no doubt that policies advocated by many of the protestors will cause economic harm across the world, especially to those hoping to climb out of poverty It is unlikely that Ms. Mercer and all of the signers would vote for the same political candidates.

So this was really geared at promoting renewables, at the expense of more affordable sources of electricity like coal and natural gas And it also had a impact on nuclear power as well. Lots of nuclear plants have closed as a result of so many renewables on the grid. Because you can’t slow down a nuclear power plant without de-stabilizing it. You can do that with coal or natural gas, so one of the main negative repercussions of these policies is that they are getting rid […] if they are supposed to be limiting CO2 emissions and they are taking nuclear power off the grid, its, eh, pretty questionable whether your goals are aligning or the results of your policies are aligning with your goals. 14:14] “So, earthquakes: This is where you have a lot of people who are like, ‘Hey, what about that?  […] Oklahoma went from having very few earthquakes above magnitude 3, to having hundreds of them So, what happens is, when you produce oil or natural gas there’s always some salt water that’s left over from the ancient oceans that help deposit the bio-matter that was deposited in these rocks, so, in Oklahoma they were producing oil from a formation called the Mississippian Lime Formation, which is essentially a saltwater well that sometimes produces oil. You get about 10 barrels of salt water for every barrel of oil, and they needed a way to dispose of this, and this is only profitable to develop that when oil is at $114 a barrel, or something insane So, they were injecting all this water into a limestone formation, but somehow this limestone formation was causing the faults in the ground to slip a little bit in a way that they hadn’t done before, and they had been using this formation to dispose of waste water for a really long time. So the main […] the takeaway from this story is that, the happy ending, is they enacted some regulations on disposing of the waste water and the earthquakes have decreased by a lot. That’s the main takeaway. Sometimes you do need regulations and I think that’s important to talk about."

Fred Palmer,United States,https://www.desmog.com/fred-palmer/,"The Vice President is correct when he intones that ‘the greenhouse effect,’ is real. Greenhouse gases in our atmosphere (primarily water vapor) make life on earth possible. They act as a thermal blanket, trapping heat radiated by the sun before it is re-radiated from earth’s surface back into space. ‘The greenhouse effect’ is not the issue hat about ‘global warming?’ What matters is the degree and rate of change. There have been times on earth when it has been much warmer than today, and times when it’s been much colder. The latter are called ice ages. One of the former is called ‘The Climate Optimum.’ It was a time of higher average global temperature and high CO2. almer concludes, “So, the global warming issue is not about the reality of the greenhouse effect, or CO, as a pollutant.

CEED was successful in the 90s and the approach used then can inform for today. Coal’s challenge today at the state level is much more serious than it was in 1992, for the simple reason that the great investor owned utilities in CEED have switched sides and they own the regulated coal plants. But the CEED model never depended on the nature of CEED’s members, it depended and depends on defending CO2 in defense of Coal. ‘Saving US Coal’ is the only entity that can do this today and its leaders were engaged directly in the 90s with CEED and succeeding years. ‘Saving US Coal’ can perform the same function today as CEED did then in a virtual way."

That is to say that my research interests are focused primarily on about the last 2 million years of Earth’s history. An important aspect of my research is assessing past climate conditions. Thus I am also a paleoclimatologist. [… I teach a general climate change course. To get the significance of this correlation over to the students I use the following analogy. I tell the students that based on these records if you believe that climate is being driven by CO2 then they probably would have no difficulty in accepting the idea that Winston Churchill was instrumental in the defeat of King Herold by Duke William of Orange at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. If you can believe that this historical temporal incongruity could be feasible then you can have no problem believing that CO2 is what’s driving Earth’s climate system.

The theory is; get rid of the (evil) coal burning plants and we save the planet from imminent doom Several problems arise when one considers the issue of global warming First, the earth is actually cooler today than it was about 50 years ago. In fact, most climatologists agree that, at best, global warming is a theory about future climactic conditions and cannot be proven based upon the historic record. Second, the greenhouse gases alluded to are real but are mostly the result of volcanoes, hurricanes and underwater geologic displacements. Regrettably, none of these causes can be corralled by environmentalists hungry for regulation and taxes and, therefore, must be ignored.  Third, even if there was global warming (there isn’t), the Global Climate Treaty brokered by Vice President Al Gore in Kyoto, Japan last year is hardly the answer."

That is the main function of this so-called agreement."
Ben Pile,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/ben-pile/,"[…] the main reason to object to the CCA [Climate Change Act] is that it reflects the growing tendency to hide from criticism behind the comforting certainty of scientific objectivity.

Along the way, it is possible that Neil made some inconsequential technical mistakes.

My main reason for being against this trend of stakeholder capitalism, what you could also refer to as woke capitalism, is that it is a perversion of how a constitutional republic, a democratic society is supposed to work. What the model of stakeholder capitalism calls for us to say that, no, no, no, we the people, can’t be trusted to sort out our differences on climate change or on social justice, but that we have to actually trust an enlightened group of elites to determine for the rest of society what the right answers are to those questions.

Some scientists and organisations give the reef only a couple of decades before it is finished … In biological circles, it is common to compare coral reefs to canaries, i.e. beautiful and delicate organisms that are easily killed. The analogy is pushed further by claiming that, just as canaries were used to detect gas in coal mines, coral reefs are the canaries of the world and their death is a first indication of our apocalyptic greenhouse future. The bleaching events of 1998 and 2002 were our warning. Heed them now or retribution will be visited upon us In fact a more appropriate creature with which to compare corals would be cockroaches – at least for their ability to survive. If our future brings us total self-annihilation by nuclear war, pollution or global warming, my bet is that both cockroaches and corals will survive. … Corals are particularly well adapted to temperature changes and in general, the warmer the better. It seems odd that coral scientists are worrying about global warming because this is one group of organisms that like it hot. Corals are most abundant in the tropics and you certainly do not find fewer corals closer to the equator. Quite the opposite, the further you get away from the heat, the worse the corals.

And predictions of doom usually prove exaggerated: eugenic deterioration, dietary fat, population growth, sperm counts, pesticides and cancer, mad cow disease, the effect of acid rain on forests. [… limate policies are hitting mainly poor people while enriching mainly wealthy people. The lack of affordable electricity in poor countries is responsible for poverty and at least three million deaths a year from indoor smoke, yet western countries and international institutions largely refuse to support the cheapest source of electricity, fossil fuels.

They’re using this this stored solar energy. And that’s what basically amounts to. And they’re using it as a very high density source of energy.  [00:14:54 00:25:59]  I don’t use the term fossil fuels because it’s been coined as a derogatory term by the climate alarmists [00:26:07 00:31:15] So if anyone complains about coal, then I’m going to say to them, they’re going to starve without coal and they’re going to live a miserable life in the dark.  [00:31:24 00:39:37]  The moral case for hydrocarbons is actually a moral case for the environment.  [00:39:42 00:57:57] And what we’ve what we can see now is the same people who are trying to control us, control our thinking and trying to control our use of energy, trying to control how we live. Their second agenda, and it’s part of the same agenda, is to control property rights. [00:58:14 00:58:34] And they’re doing it in this country all under the guise of climate and all under the guilt that you talk about.  [00:58:41 00:58:48] Now in my view, hydrocarbon fuels, the name says they’re combinations of hydrogen atoms and carbon atoms plus minor impurities when they burn. But basically those impurities these days in cars, in power stations, in blast furnaces are removed. So the impurities don’t really cause much. They scrubbed out or they’re taken out chemically. So what’s left, Alex, is H2O, because we combine the hydrogen and the carbon with oxygen. We form H2O, which is water and carbon dioxide, which is plant food and essential for all life on this planet. [00:59:24 01:08:10] Right, and I’ve got a colleague… I’ve been studying the climate issues for about 13 years now as a volunteer. No, no funding. So I’m not attached to anything. I just go off the science. And I won’t go into the details now. But we know that in Australia, for example, the temperatures today a cooler than they were in the 1880s and 1890s. I can rattle off so many different different forms of that. So we haven’t got a problem with temperature. We know that the temperature is doing this. We know that rainfall is doing that on longer cycles. We know that so many things are just cyclical in nature. I have a colleague who has amassed… he’s very, very bright. And he uses… he’s fantastic on computers. He has legally accumulated 24,000 datasets from around the world. And he most of them are about climate. Some are about energy. And he’s is a phenomenal brain. But there is no evidence anywhere that carbon dioxide from human activity is affecting the climate and needs to be cut.  [01:09:15 01:11:23] If it gets warmer, machines are useful. If it gets cooler. Machines are useful. And excuse me. I have never found anywhere, and no one has produced anywhere on this planet, evidence showing that human carbon dioxide from the use of hydrocarbon fuels needs to be cut. 01:13:48] As a saying, if we could choose the thermostat setting, we would raise the temperature of the Earth. If we could choose the CO2 levels as setting, we would increase the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And we do know that in the current atmosphere that we have in the Earth, it’s about 550 years old. The levels of carbon dioxide, were up to one hundred and thirty times what they are now. [01:14:08"

The flawed climate computer models assume that a very small increase in temperature from carbon dioxide causes the evaporation of more water, which is a strong greenhouse gas. … The climate is always changing. The geological record shows that Earth’s climate has been relatively stable for the past several thousand years and is currently unusually benign. The colder periods during the past 3,000 years caused a great amount of suffering because, during most of that time, human civilization lacked technology and was based upon relatively primitive agriculture Cold periods will come again.

I don’t think that’s deniable. But I think, that said, we should also look at, forget about what people have done. I think just we should also be aware that this fucking thing changes, and there’s ice ages back when people were knocking sticks together and hoping to start a fire, and still create an ice age.

And God only knows what the most pressing problems that confront us truly are. When I, I wandered through the ecological sustainability literature about ten years ago, and, you know, I concluded a couple of things.

Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"And I think part of the reason is I’ve been trying to understand the driving ideas underneath this globalist utopian tyranny that seems to be developing from the top down. And I think it’s driven, at least in part, by this religious vision that already described, you know, that you have to construe culture itself, especially industrial culture, as the tyrannical father raping and pillaging everything in its way, which is unbelievably dangerous way to think, too one-sided, and the, the, the idea that you have to impose limits to growth on people in order to have a sustainable planet, and that’s allied with a view that probably stems all the way back to people like Paul Ehrlich in the 1960s who really believe, really believe, truly, that maybe the planet should only have 500 million people on it, or a billion, you know, in relative poverty or 2 billion barely scraping by […].“And so when I look at ideas like that, that first assumption, you know, the planet has too many people on it. It’s like, I don’t like to hear people say that, because when I hear that, I think, okay, buddy, who exactly are you thinking about getting rid of? Oh, well, it’s not like that. It’s like, yeah, it’s like that has to be like. It is absolutely like that. And so, you know, it’s easy to get all paranoid conspiracy theorist about the WEF [World Economic Forum], say, and maybe there’s some utility in that … I’ve already felt that I been at war for the last six months. And I would say it’s war, because what I observed happening in Europe when I was there last was […] it’s pretty damn clear that the globalist utopians are willing to sacrifice the poor for the sake of the planet, you know, and they’re doing that by cranking energy prices up through the roof. And that means that people die … It’s probably nine months ago that we’re putting 350 million people at on the brink of starvation because we’re cranking energy prices up. And so for me, it’s like, that’s 350 million people. That’s three times as many as the communists killed, you know, in their six decades of trying. And if your cure for the planet is well, you know, we got to put 350 million poor people in jeopardy just so that things are hypothetically better in 100 years, I think. Yeah, I don’t think so, buddy. And also, it’s a little bit too convenient for me that your prescriptions to save the planet are in company by this insistence that the only way forward to that is to give you all the power. It’s like there’s a bit of a moral hazard in that, don’t you think? It’s like I’m just saving the planet. Give me all the power. It’s like you want to save the planet. Or do you want the power?

It’s like, you know, I had on Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock yesterday and the podcast will be released on Thursday. And it’s this amazing podcast talking about moments in the Earth’s history where the Earth experienced asteroid impacts, comet impacts, and that there’s a period around 12,000 something years ago where we for sure got hit by these big impacts of either exploding in the sky above Earth or hitting the ground. And there’s plenty of, like, physical evidence of this, and it’s called the Younger Dryas impact theory. But they were talking about the rapid change in the climate, how the sea levels rose, the ice caps melted, all because we got pummeled by asteroids. Like, this shit has gone on forever.

We’ve gotten better genetic strains of plants, but some of it also is more CO2. Plants love CO2. We put CO2 into greenhouses to get them to grow more. They also love warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons. “And so, for example, I don’t like to cite, you know, this year, etc., but I will in this case, you know, India has seen record grain harvests this year more than any other year. And long term over the world the yields have been going up. Okay. Because it’s getting warmer, we’re getting better at agronomy, and there’s more CO2. ogan: “Is there a point of diminishing returns? Like is there a point where there’s so much CO2 in the atmosphere that then it becomes detrimental?"
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"What I think we will do, looking at all the drivers, is we’re going to adapt. That’s going to be the main way in which we will respond to a changing climate. And, you know, adaptation has got a lot of things going for it. It doesn’t matter whether the climate is changing because of human influences or because of natural phenomena. It’s proportional. If the climate changes a lot, we’ll adapt a lot. If climate changes a little, we’ll adapt a little. Adaptation is local, and so it’s much more palatable politically. You’re spending for the here and now and not for something halfway around the world and a couple generations away. And it’s also very effective.“Consider the following that the globe, as I showed you, has warmed about a degree centigrade, two degrees Fahrenheit since 1900. During that time, we’ve seen the greatest improvement in human welfare we’ve ever had. The population in 1900 was 2 billion people. Today, it’s almost eight, so it’s gone up by a factor of four. And we’ve seen spectacular improvement in nutrition, in health, in literacy, etc., etc. Right. To think that another 1 or 1 and a half degrees is going to completely derail that just beggars belief. … ogan: “Now, when you talk about adaptation and you talk about the rise in the global temperature, so if it does rise up a couple degrees, what sort of adaptation will be required, and what areas of the world, or at least of our country, will actually benefit from a warming? Is that is that a real factor?"

Global warming. That, you know, we’re responsible for catastrophic climate change.“What you don’t want to really be talking about too much is that there has been repeated episodes, too many to count, episodes of catastrophic climate change that we had nothing to do with. We were not the perpetrators. We were the victims. … ogan: “But like when people are talking about global warming, there’s many things that they’re concerned with. But one of the things that they’re concerned with is the cities, like Miami, that are like, in porous, porous ground that are right on the coast, like then, that’s going to go underwater in 20 years. arlson: “If. If the ocean levels keep rising. If they do. However, I … I’m a bit skeptical because … I won’t pull it up now, but I could pull up and show you probably 500 articles on the importance of the sun in warming and cooling that have been mostly ignored in the IPCC’s models and projections of climate change.“And if we go into another solar minimum, like the Maunder Minimum or the Spörer Minimum, yeah, we’re in for decades of cold weather and we’re going to see ice growing again. … arlson: “In the early 90s and stuff, the assumption was that the sun was not playing a role, and so we don’t need to look at the sun. If you eliminate all the natural variables until only carbon dioxide is left, and that’s pretty much where we’re still at, because by the time you get into the 2000s and it was becoming apparent that the sun was actually a much more important factor in climate change and had been acknowledged. By that point, it had already, the whole scenario had already become entrenched, and you now had huge amounts of money being poured into that whole scenario."

It’s … okay … but your models aren’t based on everything. Your models are based on a set number of variables. oe Rogan: “Yeah. eterson: “So that means you’ve reduced the variables, which are everything, to that set. Well, how did you decide which set of variables to include in the equation if it’s about everything? And that’s not just a criticism. That’s like, if it’s about everything, your models aren’t right, because your models do not and cannot model everything. ogan: “What do you mean by everything when you say– eterson: “Well. That’s what people who talk about the climate apocalypse claim In some sense. We have to change everything. It’s like everything, eh? Okay … what? And the same with the word environment. That word doesn’t mean … it means so much, that it actually doesn’t mean anything. Like when you say everything, in a sense that’s meaningless, right? Because … well, what are you pointing to? Well I’m pointing to everything. Well, what’s the difference between the environment and everything? There’s no difference. What’s the difference between climate and everything? Well, there’s no difference. So this is a crisis of everything. It’s like, no, it’s not. Or if it is … well, if it really is, then we’re done because we can’t fix everything. But we have to."

And so, so the idea that there’s any source of energy that we can derive, that’s not going to produce some pollutant as a consequence?

And ‘misleading’ is a really subjective thing, right?"
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"My view is, the drug crisis is objectively a much bigger threat to human life and to civilization than climate change. Like we’re adapted really well to climate change. We should do something about it, it’s real, there are risks associated with it, but like, there’s no scenario in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of climate change killing 93,000 Americans a year. In fact there’s no scenario of it killing … of it increasing deaths from natural disasters at all."

We still have a need to believe in some higher power. And so we make new religions. And the problem with the new religions, whether it’s climate apocalypse– oe Rogan: “Wokeism. hellenberger: “Or wokeism. Or victimology. The problem is that the people that are … that are the adherents to those new religions don’t think that they’re promoting a new religion. They think that they’re ‘just being more compassionate’ or ‘I’m just being more sensitive’ or whatever. ogan: “Yeah."
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"oe Rogan: “I’m very curious about this, because this idea of, enforced equality, right, ensuring that there is such a high emphasis placed on equality, that you have the equal amount of men, and equal amount of women, and the opportunities are absolutely available as much to women as they are to men, this is enforced, that this creates an environment where there’s less resistance now, an environment where there’s less resistance. Perhaps women don’t feel as compelled to say, ‘I’ll show you.' ordan Peterson: “Yeah, that’s … that is what seems to happen … We have this reflexive idea, and this is very much the case because this is like the core idea among the feminist neo-Marxist types is that if there’s differences in outcome, that’s … that’s proof of prejudice and that support for the idea of the patriarchal tyranny, and that’s like the core axiom of the radical left is the patriarchal tyranny, as far as I’m concerned. That’s God for them, the patriarchal tyranny. It’s like, well, if it turns out that many of these differences in outcome between men and women aren’t a consequence of the patriarchal tyranny, in fact, even get bigger when you reduce the tyrannical aspect of the patriarch and even the patriarchal aspect to it, then it makes that theory not only wrong, but opposite of the truth, which is the worst kind of wrong … Men are more likely to work outside. They’re more likely to work in dangerous businesses. They’re more likely to run full-time businesses rather than part-time businesses. And, they’re more likely to move in pursuit of their career goals. And that all contributes to differences in … and in among Uber drivers there, they make 7% more money because they drive faster. So. And so anyways. ogan: “That’s not good though. eterson:"
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"ogan: “The problem seems to be … when discussing these things … in any way romanticizing, or glorifying male behavior, or putting any emphasis whatsoever on there being a positive aspect to a lot of the things that we think of as being negative, like aggression or ambition or competition. Competition amongst men is fine. Competition with men against women is often thought of as cruel. eterson: “Yeah… Well that… Yes, well and … and there’s a certain amount of reason for that, as well, because obviously physical competition is … it’s easy for that to border on cruel. ogan: “This is why we were … we were talking before the show … that instead of calling people ‘men’ and ‘women’ when referring to like … because there’s … there’s this very disturbing, in my opinion, trend of transgender women entering into these competitions now with women who are biologically female, and dominating them, and that, instead of calling people, ‘men’ and ‘women’, let’s dispense with that."
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"… eterson: “And you know that the issue with men, I think with young men, and this is one of the things I’ve been trying to address, is that if your fundamental presupposition is that our culture is a patriarchal tyranny, which is an appalling presupposition, along with the idea that the best way of looking at history is that it was the oppression, the continual oppression of women by men, which is also something that I regard as an absolutely reprehensible doctrine. Then, okay, so it’s a patriarchal tyranny. ogan: “But that in their defense, that did exist, there has been continual oppression of women. It’s just not the only thing that’s happened. There’s certain women that have been revered. There’s been women that have been celebrated, there’s been women that have accomplished great things, but there’s been a lot of oppression. So if they concentrate primarily on that oppression, and that’s their main point of study, and that’s the thing they want to talk about all the time, they kind of have a point in the fact that if you’re looking at all the events that have ever taken place, there’s a significant number of them that have been women being oppressed. eterson: “Yeah, but I don’t know. I don’t know if there’s more women who’ve been oppressed than men who’ve been oppressed. ogan: “A very good point."
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"ordan Peterson: “So Title IX… Title IX originally was just a piece of legislation that that ensured that women would have equal access to sports events and so forth at the universities. That’s what it was designed for. But it’s become this umbrella legislation that pushes equality of outcome essentially across every possible dimension in the universities. And it’s been used as a weapon by the radical left. But, you know, some of that’s driven by legislative necessity. […"
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"The reason that I think this is coming from the universities is because I don’t think that this could. Well, there’s all these activist disciplines that are essentially subsidized by too-high tuition fees and also by state funding, and they’ve produced an entire substructure of of activists. And those activists are doing everything they can to lay out the theoretical structure for the radical left, and that’s a that’s a structure that involves… There’s buzzwords, right? Diversity is one. But that means diversity by race and ethnicity and sexual preference, for example, as if those have anything to do with genuine diversity of ideation. And they don’t. And there’s no evidence that they do. Inclusivity. I’m never even sure what that means. Equity, which is a marker for, what would you call it? It’s a code word in some sense for equality of outcome, which is an absolutely deadly doctrine. I think of all the mistakes that the radical left are making and the moderate left for not calling them out on it, the equity doctrine is at the top of the list. And then there’s other associated things like white privilege that’s a good one, and systemic bias, and, which is an absolute embarrassment from the perspective of a, of a reasonable academic psychologist, because psychological tests have been used to prove that there’s this implicit bias that that lurks everywhere, and the tests aren’t reliable and valid enough to make that claim …"
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"You are villainized in a weird way, where, I can’t believe that these people are honestly looking at your opinions and coming up with these conclusions. I can’t help but feel like what is happening is people are consciously deciding to ignore reality and paint you as this archetypal figure of oppressive, white male patriarchy, ignorance … fill in the blank with all the rest of the descriptives that you’d like to use. But they’ve decided to paint you in this way, like as a target, because they need a target to sort of reinforce this idea that transgender people are being victimized and women are being victimized."
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"A lot of the people who were protesting were standing behind a hammer and sickle banner, you know, which just absolutely amazes me because… I still haven’t been able to quite figure this out. I can’t figure out why you couldn’t do that with a Nazi symbol, but you can do that with a hammer and sickle. You know, there’s a reason. Maybe it’s because the Nazi doctrine was so explicitly racist, but God, it’s not like the hammer and sickle wasn’t equally murderous, or actually quite profoundly more murderous, as it turned out."
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"ordan Peterson: “Well, with Bill C16, which was the bill that I was complaining about, or criticizing, let’s say, there’s a variety of surrounding policy documents that are derived from the Ontario Human Rights Commission, and they they indicate quite clearly that you’re to regard biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual proclivity as varying independently, which, of course, they don’t by any stretch of the imagination. They’re so tightly correlated that, well, you can’t use correlation to imply cause or to infer causality. But Jesus, when the correlations are above 0.95, you have to start wondering if there’s actually not some causal link, and it’s absurd to me that we really even have to have that discussion. But the notion… And this is being taught to school kids. This is mainstream doctrine, Joe. I mean, the gender … look up the gender unicorn, that’s a fun thing to look up.

Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"ordan Peterson: “Well, I think it’s partly. It’s partly a form of narcissism."
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"oe Rogan: “Yeah, you’re oppressed, or your opinions rather are suppressed, and you are automatically put into this category of people who should be dismissed because of the fact that you have white privilege. You should step back and let others talk. You should step back. And this is a narrative that gets repeated over and over again in the social justice warrior culture. This idea that you should just step back and let these others talk because they understand. ordan Peterson: “Yeah. And the others are always other group members. Right. And somehow their, their discourse is to be privileged in reverse, because hypothetically, they’re a member of an oppressed class. Of course. And you can multiply the numbers of oppressed classes ad nauseam, which is another part of the problem.Rogan: “Yeah. Like the idea is that in giving them privilege because they have been marginalized, you will balance things out. You will somehow or another reverse this. eterson: “Yeah. But and that’s another example of the class-based guilt idea. You know, it’s, it doesn’t seem to me self-evident that I’m to blame for slavery, for example. I mean, being a Canadian, it’s a slightly different situation, I suppose, but the the idea that as the member, as a member of a culture that you’re somehow responsible for the past sins of that culture, let’s say it, it’s a very, very anti-Western ethos."
Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"ogan: “Well, there’s also a very disingenuous way of framing it here in America, where people consistently, even the president of the United States, Obama, always talking about income inequality and the way they frame income inequality. They talk about the $0.79 to the dollar. But what they don’t discuss is that we’re talking about completely different careers. The way they frame it … they frame it as if two people are working side by side. One is a man, one is a woman. They’re both doing the same job. The man makes a dollar. The woman makes $0.79. That is not the case. eterson: “It’s typical of ideological conversation because what happens technically … like imagine that again … we talked about poverty a few minutes ago, and you said, ‘Well, there’s there’s many, many reasons that one person might have more money than another.’ There are many, many reasons why women might make less money on average than men. There are small businesses that women run, for example, make far less money than men’s, than small businesses that men run. But that’s partly because a lot of women run their businesses part-time because they have kids. “It’s also partly because men do all the horrible, dangerous jobs. The ones where there’s a high chance of dying. Men are much more likely to work outside. Men are much more likely to move in in pursuit of a career opportunity. There are lots of reasons that men and women differ in terms of their income. But if you’re an ideologue, you can only handle one variable. Oh, men and women measured en masse don’t have the same incomes, therefore the system is corrupt. Jesus. How much thinking does it take to come up with a with a theoretical scenario like that? It’s so boneheaded and it just runs. It just pushes the ideological. It just pushes the ideology forward with no thought."

Joe Rogan,United States,https://www.desmog.com/joe-rogan/,"andall Carlson: “Absolutely. And like Graham mentioned earlier, there’s kind of a … it went from a religious motive, I think, in the 19th century. And now it’s more a political motive. And again, the idea that every day you’ll find something, you know, coming from various factions that oh, we’re destroying the Earth, and the Earth has never suffered this kind of, you know, assault on it before. And, and, you know, we’re causing the sixth great mass extinction, and we’re going to cause catastrophic global warming if we pump another 50 or 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. “And so what that has done is, like many, I won’t say many, but several of the scientists now that have been in the forefront of criticizing the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis are also very much involved in the global warming movement and the idea that we are now precipitating the sixth great mass extinction. Having looked now at mass extinctions, and been a really an obsession of mine for about 30 years now, I’ve looked at everything from the Cretaceous Tertiary, the Permian, Triassic, you know, right on down the line to the most recent one, which to me is really in some ways the most interesting, because the most recent mass extinction that we’re talking about is the one that took place while we humans were part of the story."

But there’s all kinds of other things going on. For example, cosmic rays are constantly bombarding the Earth, right?

Norman Rogers,United States,https://www.desmog.com/norman-rogers/,I’ve discovered that if a person is committed to green ideology it is very difficult to change their mind about global warming alarmism. This is true even if they are technically qualified and able to understand scientific arguments. You can’t change their thinking because their thinking is faith based. In other words they have come to believe in a green religion. Even though these believers could have a green religion without global warming they are very reluctant to let go of global warming because it is a justification for other tenets of the green religion like using less energy. However scientific arguments and facts are very important for informing people who are open minded on the subject of global warming.
Norman Rogers,United States,https://www.desmog.com/norman-rogers/,"There are very eminent older climate scientists, like Richard Lindzen and Roger Pielke Sr. that are publicly critical of the green doctrine. These are scientists who are so accomplished and established as to be immune to retaliation. Mid-career climate scientists, like Roy Spencer and John Christy, both from the University of Alabama Huntsville, are critical of global warming doctrine and have done very important scientific work trying to point the science in a sounder direction.

What I found, was a 78-year-old man with more energy and enthusiasm than I could match. We spoke at length, and I learned a number of surprising things. […] I learned for instance, about his passion for criminal justice reform But I was most surprised by his commitment to reinvigorate the skilled trades. I knew his foundation focused on many forms of higher education, but I had no idea we shared a common view regarding the skills gap. He pointed out that countless small businesses begin with a tradesperson who learned a skill that was in demand. I shared my belief that a chronic skills gap was more troubling than chronic unemployment, because the existence of opportunity that people don’t care about is more alarming than a lack of opportunity overall In short, we found ourselves in violent agreement on a number of things important to us both, and after lunch, he told me to let him know if mikeroweWORKS could ever use his help.

What we need to do is figure out how to plan so that whatever happens, we’re doing something sensible. The clean power plan itself is problematic in that it costs so much money, and will upset some of the work we do on our electric grid to such a degree that we need to have enormous confidence that the kind of changes the EPA currently wants make good sense. For example, if we want to get rid of carbon, one of the best solutions would be to go to nuclear energy. The science is still out. I’m a Ph.D. scientist, and people say ‘well, you’re a skeptic’ and my answer is ‘well, all scientists are skeptics. That’s what being a scientist is.’ And, so when you hear a consensus saying ‘gee, we think this is a big problem,’ and then you actually look at the real science, and you find out, gosh, the temperature has not gone the way we predicted it would, we have to go back and ask ‘how are our assumptions doing? Are we really right?’ And when we’re talking about the size of investment we’re talking about, we need to have a great deal of confidence.

Naomi Seibt,Germany,https://www.desmog.com/naomi-seibt/,"aomi Seibt: [00:03:30] The climate has been changing for millions of years. But we need to be more precise in our questions and ask things like are CO2 emissions actually that destructive to the planet? Are they really the cause of global warming or are there other factors playing into this, like, for example, the impact that the sun has on the climate and water feedback, water feedback, water evaporations, there are so many other factors that are way stronger than just CO2 emissions. So it is ridiculous to believe that humans could have such a big impact on the climate. We cannot mess with nature in that way. At least that’s the conclusion that I’ve come to. [00:04:10 aomi Seibt: [00:04:10] I’m doing my own research and the claims that the IPCC puts out there are mostly just based on climate models. So really just computer models, computer games that they came up with themselves. [00:04:20][9.4 aomi Seibt: [00:04:51]  I would say that actually most scientists belong to this alleged consensus, they don’t really know about the CO2 emissions science themselves, but those are just scientists who work in different fields. [00:05:06 aomi Seibt: [00:05:33] But first of all, it is just a very minor greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Most agree most people don’t know that’s the main greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is actually water, water vapor and then the manmade emissions, CO2 emissions are making just making up just a tiny fraction of CO2 emissions in general. [00:05:55 aomi Seibt: [00:06:16]  And the problem with those models is that basically just computer games and that’s not based on real world data.  [00:06:24"
Naomi Seibt,Germany,https://www.desmog.com/naomi-seibt/,"aomi Seibt: [00:08:06] It’s just that she is not about the science.

And that belief has nothing to do with science and skepticism anymore. [00:08:27"
Naomi Seibt,Germany,https://www.desmog.com/naomi-seibt/,"aomi Seibt: [00:11:03] Well, I don’t actually agree that it’s having a negative effect on the planet. It’s just a natural phenomenon. So the climate has always been changing. And of course, we will always experience natural catastrophes. And what can we do about them? Certainly not reducing CO2 emissions. That’s the wrong way to deal with natural catastrophes.  [00:11:26"

Let’s bring in Naomi Seibt. She is a 19-year-old from Germany whose willingness to ask questions has earned her spot at CPAC tomorrow. It’s good to have you here, Naomi. So you have been hired by the Center for Climate and Environmental Policy, and you have just a different view about climate. What is it about the current narrative that kind of drives you crazy? AOMI SEIBT (HEARTLAND INSTITUTE): “Well, it is mostly that there is so much fearmongering going on about this entire climate change propaganda that is being put out there. And I hate to see so many young people especially panicking about climate change, about a topic that they haven’t even done their research about. Because many young people, they claim to know a lot about the science, but they really don’t. And I tried approaching those young people in my own town and from all over the world, and most of them don’t really know what they are talking about. And they are just so fearful of what is to come. And I want to give them back their hope.  EIBT: “I absolutely believe that climate change is real. You shouldn’t ask the question ‘is climate change real,’ because climate change has always been real. The climate has been changing for millions and billions of years. But what you should actually be asking is are humans actually destroying the planet with man-made CO2 emissions. ERINO: “And your position on that is what? EIBT: “My position on that is no, CO2 emissions are not actually harmful to the planet. Because if you want I can talk about it more thoroughly – ERINO: “No, that’s OK. We don’t have enough time to get into all of it, I just wanted to make sure. It’s not that you think that climate change is not real, but you believe that humans have no contribution to climate change? EIBT: “They might contribute slightly, but I think it is so insignificant that we shouldn’t focus on that. Especially we should not rush to solutions that are really not sustainable in the long term. Yeah. ERINO: “I hear you. EIBT: “That is the main issue."

[00:03:05 … aomi Seibt: [00:03:34] I started to understand that economics and politics was not just about the government or was not just science on its own, but was fundamentally a huge philosophical question. It was basically I finally understood that really everything that we’re talking about in politics and economics and even the climate change topic, in the end, it’s all about liberty versus authoritarianism.  [00:04:12"

What do you think about that?  [00:16:15 aomi Seibt: [00:16:17] Yes, definitely, because we’ve been able to lift so many people out of poverty because we finally have access to to a fantastic energy source which provides us with so many opportunities. And the alternatives as of now are not sustainable enough to to do the same thing, to help so many people become more efficient in their everyday life. [00:16:48 aomi Seibt: [00:16:56] The climate alarmists keep talking about ridiculous tiny issues like plastic bags and plastic straws. [00:17:04][8.0 aomi Seibt: [00:17:32] We just have to realize that it is absolutely, well, disgusting, to be honest, to claim that we have only we’ve we’ve not benefited from fossil fuels at all and that really they’re just destroying the planet because, no, they are making our lives not only easier, but way safer than if we were just running around in nature.  [00:17:57 aomi Seibt: [00:21:41] They [Liberals] portray us as the Nazis and they say that we will be the ones who promote dictatorships, which is absolutely ludicrous. We are the ones really fighting for freedom here. And the increase of taxes is a direct path to more socialism, of course, and more authoritarianism.

Nir Shaviv,"United States, Israel",https://www.desmog.com/nir-shaviv/,"[W]hen there are fewer ions, the clouds that are formed are composed of large drops. Clouds of this type are less white and refract less of the sun’s rays outward, and so the heat is preserved and the earth gets warmer,"

And then and then you can see that it becomes the devil and then you’re trying to get away from it. You’re going to the angels, which just renewables. I mean, the overall cosmology of apocalyptic environmentalism is kind of so basic and dumb. It’s almost embarrassing to when you describe it, you know, you’re kind of like God, I can’t believe people really believe this, but that is what’s going on. It’s ultimately this idea that with renewables, we’re going to harmonize ourselves with the new god of nature.

So all else being equal, yes, it would be better. But but we have every reason to believe that deaths from natural disasters, food surpluses and disease will continue to go down in the future. There’s no reason that that should not occur. So, yes, I agree with you. If you want to solve pollution problems, we should do it the way we’ve always done it, which is making our ways of making electricity cleaner. Mostly, by the way, it’s through natural gas and nuclear, not through renewables."
Michael Shellenberger,United States,https://www.desmog.com/michael-shellenberger/,Deaths from natural disasters are going down around the world. They’ve been going down 90 percent. It’s just wonderful. We should celebrate it. Few of our loved ones are being swept away in floods and hurricanes. All of the increase in property damage is due to the fact that we’ve become wealthier. So the idea that people can see climate change in natural disasters is completely fallacious. That’s not science. That’s misinformation.
Michael Shellenberger,United States,https://www.desmog.com/michael-shellenberger/,"You need a capital heavily capitalized oil and gas industry to be able to make the transition away from coal, which is what’s been occurring in the United States, and as well as economic development is the main factor in making sure that the deaths from natural disasters, that the global disease burden continues to decline. So I think the focus on making sure that we protect continued economic growth, which requires cheap energy. I think that it has been and should remain our highest priority."
Michael Shellenberger,United States,https://www.desmog.com/michael-shellenberger/,"Clearly, the great success story of the last several decades is this is the is this abundance of natural gas.

Our carbon emissions have gone down over the last 15 years in Apocalypse Never talk about how that’s actually due to the fracking natural gas revolution, which most environmentalists oppose.

And then science is supposed to be sort of the new religion. But, of course, it creates all sorts of problems because that’s not what science is. Science doesn’t behave that way, behaves like science. And so. Yeah. So basically, these are problems of environmentalists treating science as though it’s a religion."

Michael Shellenberger,United States,https://www.desmog.com/michael-shellenberger/,"00:05:46] Over time, it gradually struck me that there was really no amount of technological innovation that was going to make the sun shine more regularly or wind blow more reliably. In fact, nothing. [00:05:59][12.8 00:11:52] All of which I think raises a really uncomfortable question in the effort to try to save the climate, are we destroying the environment? [00:11:59][7.3 00:12:19] Poor countries around the world are in the process still of moving away from wood and dung as their primary energies. And for the most part, this is a positive thing. As you stop using wood as your major source of fuel, it allows the forest to grow back and the wildlife to return as you stop burning wood in your home. You don’t. You no longer need to breathe that toxic smoke. And as you go from coal to natural gas and uranium is your main sources of energy. t holds out the possibility of basically eliminating air pollution altogether. There’s just this problem with nuclear. Well, it’s been pretty popular to move from dirtier to cleaner energy sources, from energy diffuse to energy dense sources. Nuclear is just really unpopular for a bunch of historical reasons. And as a consequence, in the past, I and I think a lot of others have sort of said, well, in order to deal with climate change, we’re just going to need all the different kinds of clean energy that we have. The problem is, is that just turns out not to be true. [00:13:17][58.7 00:14:07] in places that are using a lot of nuclear or have grids that are mostly nuclear and hydro, going towards solar and wind and other renewables would actually increase carbon emissions. I think a better alternative is just to tell the truth. [00:14:21][14.6 00:16:46] I think it’s natural that those of us that became very concerned about climate change, such a big environmental issue, would gravitate towards really romantic solutions, like harmonizing human civilization with the natural world using renewable energies. But I think it’s also understandable that as the facts have come in, that many of us have started to question our prior beliefs and change our minds. For me, the question now is now that we know that renewables can’t save the planet. Are we going to keep letting them destroy it? [00:17:19][32.5"
Michael Shellenberger,United States,https://www.desmog.com/michael-shellenberger/,"ichael Shellenberger: [00:06:00] We I met one of the other co-founders of Breakthrough Institute. Ted Nordhaus is also my coauthor working to save the last ancient redwoods. [00:06:09][8.9 ichael Shellenberger: [00:06:10] But when it came to climate change, we really started to lose confidence that our colleagues in the environmental community knew what they were doing. And we really didn’t know how bad it was until around 2004 when we started doing interviews with environmental leaders trying to understand what their strategy was on climate change. [00:06:28][18.4 ichael Shellenberger: [00:06:29] And we came to the conclusion that really the problem with the whole environmental approach to climate was this very narrow way of thinking about the environment. And so we wrote an essay called The Death of Environmentalism Cause a lot of international debate. We did a standard into a full-length book in 2007 called Breakthrough. And what’s stayed the same and over that last 10 years is our belief that technological innovation and making cleaner energy sources cheap is the key to dealing with climate change and other environmental problems. What’s changed is that we’ve come to see a different set of technologies as the most important technologies for dealing with environmental problems [00:07:14][44.5 ichael Shellenberger: [00:08:27] Well, so in terms of I mean, since we’ve just been we’ve been peeling the onion, trying to understand both, you know, what we think matters in terms of making a better world and also why it is that environmentalism is the way it is. And so one of the things that struck us very early on, and it obviously strikes a lot of other people, is that environmentalism is just really depressing. Like, you just you listen to it and you feel bad. And there’s reasons for that, because the story it’s telling me is a depressing story. [00:09:01][33.3 ichael Shellenberger: [00:11:15] environmentalism really doesn’t have that much to do with the environment. And if you look at the founding of the environmental movement, one of the most important things about it in the late 60s and early 70s is that it had this idea that there was too many people, people were destroying the world. [00:11:33][18.5 ichael Shellenberger: [00:12:42] Nihilism in some sense is really the motivating concern of environmentalism. And really what nihilism does is it says we need to choke off human energy, human creativity, human ingenuity. [00:12:50][8.9 ichael Shellenberger: [00:19:20] I think you saw that on the Eco Modernist manifesto. I mean, mostly the people who attacked were the deep greens. [00:19:26][5.4 ichael Shellenberger: [00:19:28] You know, not the mainstream environmental groups or mainstream environmental leaders or thinkers. And that’s because the deep Greens are actually quite happy to come out and admit that they want this completely radical change in society. They want. You know, degrowth, you know, they want less, they want and they don’t want less economic growth. They want reversal of growth. And they’re much more openly, more honest about their intentions. [00:19:56][27.9 ichael Shellenberger: [00:25:38] I think that that’s sort of the big confusion that people had, is that the environmental movement was really about the environment. 00:25:47] You know, we had a conservation movement before. There was an environmental movement. It would mostly very wealthy people. But also, you know, activists persuaded the United States government to set aside special places. Environmental movement really was an anti-nuclear movement. [00:26:02][15.5 00:26:22] The environmental has been, you know, had a problem, which is that it was against nuclear energy, which was which everybody knew was the cleanest and greenest source of energy. I mean, everybody knew it. [00:26:34][11.4 00:26:34] I mean, ever all the entire scientific class tests, scientific and technical class, the journalists I mean, everybody knew you could produce a huge amount of power with very small material inputs, very small amount of waste, no air and water pollution on an on a tiny footprint of land. And so the environment movement had a problem. It had to attack that energy source. [00:26:58][23.8 00:27:01] And they had to start making up reasons why nuclear was not environmental. And they still do. They emphasized a lot about the waste, but really it didn’t anything to do with the environment. It really was about choking off the source of the energy that drives human development and modernization civilization. [00:27:23][21.3 ichael Shellenberger: [00:33:14] The renewables discourse, the anti-nuclear renewables discourse was basically set up, and the agenda was set up, to move to a low energy civilization. [00:33:23][9.6 ichael Shellenberger: [00:38:58] one of the one of the projects that Breakthrough is looking at is actually trying to get some clarity about what if you if you accelerate the transition from coal to natural gas and you accelerate the transition of everything to nuclear. What do we think that would mean for climate over the next century? What would what do we think that would mean for for climate stabilization over the next century? But, you know, I don’t want to get too. I think sometimes there’s some people on all sides of this who profess, I think, a level of certainty that I don’t think is appropriate, and I think that the quantifications cannot actually just be more and more misleading than they are revealing. [00:39:40][42.2 ichael Shellenberger: [00:45:44] There’s just there’s the nihilistic Malthusian anti energy anti development anti human wing of the environmental movement called the Dark Greens. They’re obviously never going to be with us. But I have a lot of faith that conservationists will continue to see the wisdom of this approach of ecological modernization over this attempt to sort of starve the beast of its energy. [00:46:08][24.0"

By this we mean that even dramatic limits to per capita global consumption would be insufficient to achieve significant climate mitigation.

A combination of subsidy changes–removing them from fossil fuels, enhancing them for new renewables–mandated production targets and intensified R&D could accelerate the transition to renewables, but it is unlikely to displace all fossil fuels in a few decades, particularly as many low income countries will rely on them for their development. We should not forget that the environmentally least disruptive action is not to turn to new technical solutions to produce more energy in different ways, but simply to do with less. ‘Less is more’ has never been more desirable than in the case of tackling the rising levels of atmospheric CO2"
Vaclav Smil,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/vaclav-smil/,"The myth that the future belongs to electric cars is one of the original misconceptions of the modern energy era, dating back to the introduction of the very first passenger vehicles. ’Flipping the switch’ and going electric will not solve America’s automotive dependence on imported oil, either in the near- or long-term. A far better use of resources would be to focus on the development of more efficient gasoline-powered engines; there is no reason the U.S. fleet should not average 50 mpg rather than today’s average of less than 25 mpg."
Vaclav Smil,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/vaclav-smil/,"A new energy myth was created by the country’s most famous Nobel Prize-winner in July 2008 when former Vice President Al Gore claimed that America’s entire thermal electricity generation industry could be replaced by ‘green’ alternatives in a single decade: ‘Today I challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon-free sources within 10 years. This goal is achievable, affordable, and transformative.’ Transformative it would be, but it would certainly not be affordable, and, even if it were, it could never be accomplished in such a short period of time."
Vaclav Smil,Canada,https://www.desmog.com/vaclav-smil/,"While fossil fuels remain the very foundation of modern economic growth, spreading prosperity and a decent quality of life, they are no longer seen in that light. Rather, they are perceived as undesirable, outright dangerous, or even immoral, since their continuing use is thought to pose an unprecedented threat to the survival of modern civilization. Growing fears about rapid global warming caused by emissions of CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels are behind this increasingly stringent judgment, and these fears feed (mostly unrealistic) visions of an accelerated global transition to nonfossil energies. Coal has always been more polluting in terms of particulate matter and sulfur oxide emissions than other hydrocarbons, and because it also has the highest CO2 emissions per unit of released energy, it is seen as the most undesirable choice. A closer look at coal’s attributes and the history of its use shows that this judgment is unfair and suggests that if the fuel’s conversion were done with the most efficient techniques available today, we would have no reason to view it so negatively.  Crude oil—largely because of the continuing indispensability of refined fuels for the entire transportation sector occupies a more exalted place than coal. Although its considerable environmental impact is a concern, the main worry about oil is that its global extraction may peak in the very near future, and that this peak will not be followed by a prolonged production plateau but, rather, by a steep decline that will bring a multitude of economic and social hardships—in the most extreme versions, the end of modern civilization. That is why the first myth I debunk in this part of the book is the peak  oil myth."

Unfortunately, the data and our understanding are insufficient to usefully quantify the climate’s response to human influences. However, even as human influences have quadrupled since 1950, severe weather phenomena and sea level rise show no significant trends attributable to them.

The IPCC assessments have been too conservative in recognizing the importance of these human climate forcings as they alter regional and global climate. These assessments have also not communicated the inability of the models to accurately forecast the spread of possibilities of future climate. The forecasts, therefore, do not provide any skill in quantifying the impact of different mitigation strategies on the actual climate response that would occur."
Roger A. Pielke Sr.,United States,https://www.desmog.com/roger-pielke-sr/,"There are natural explanations for global warming of which a change in the output of solar energy is a candidate. However, none of the published work has convinced me that this can explain much of the observed global warming over the last several decades. Volcanic emissions are another natural global forcing, and it is well known that they produce cooling, such as after the eruption of Mount Pintatubo, where in August of 1991 it was estimated as -4 Watts per meter squared. There have not been eruptions of that magnitude since, such that the absence of such major eruptions might permit greater absorbed solar radiation in the climate system than otherwise would occur. However, this absence of eruptions resulting in any positive radiative imbalance for a period of time well after a major volcanic emission has also not been shown to occur. This leaves anthropogenic emissions as a source for global warming. […] we limit the communication to policymakers if we use climate change as a synonym for global warming.

Philip Stott,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/philip-stott/,"Energy policy should aim to provide a reliable mix of energy generation to support economic growth, with the least possible dependence on imported fuels. We must recognize the wisdom of James Lovelock’s brave declaration that, for the mid-term, there is no alternative to nuclear power. As the Royal Society concludes, ‘in the short to medium term, it is difficult to see how we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels without the help of nuclear power."
Philip Stott,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/philip-stott/,"In addition, while being honest about the peaking of fossil fuels, we have to continue to support their efficient use, including ‘Orimulsion’ tars, but especially coal, which is due for a resurgence. […] Our ultimate energy policy must comprise some mix of clean coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. There is no practical alternative. However, because of the problems of ocean acidification, we should support research into the long-term geological storage of carbon dioxide."
Philip Stott,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/philip-stott/,"From the very start, the whole discussion – or perhaps more properly rhetoric – has been flawed, above all because of the remarkable failure to recognise that climate change is the norm, and that climate varies at all scales, all the time, and not just in our ‘ever-so-important’ lifetime or under human influence"
Philip Stott,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/philip-stott/,…
Philip Stott,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/philip-stott/,"The idea that climate change can be attributed to just one or two politically chosen factors, such as the so-called ‘greenhouse gases’, like carbon dioxide and methane, is simply very bad science. Climate change is controlled by millions of interlinked factors, ranging from the swish of a butterfly’s wing, through 11- and 22-year solar magnetic cycles, volcanism, ocean-atmospheric linkages, sunspot activity, shorter duration wobbles of the Earth, to 96,000-year orbital changes and even intermittent meteor impacts. The intrinsic complexity of all these myriad links still totally defeats our climate modellers, many of whom cannot even account for the variation of water vapour, the most important greenhouse gas of all, and this means that climate change remains largely unpredictable. Moreover, this inherent unpredictability should warn us that, when, God-like, we try to adjust one or two of the factors involved, such as greenhouse gas emissions, our very best intentions may bring about results we neither expect nor want. We have no knowledge of how the tiny changes we initiate may interact with all the other ever-changing cycles."
Philip Stott,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/philip-stott/,"‘Global warming’ is part of a misguided agenda that seeks stability when change is the norm on this ever-restless Earth. The same agenda is employed against the use of biotechnology, against the genetic modification of crops, against the very things that help humankind to outpace change in population, pests, diseases and, above all, climate — whether hotter, wetter, colder, drier, or a mixture of all four. The idea of ‘global warming’ is potentially dangerous precisely because it gives the false impression that we might be able to halt climate change by fiddling about with just one or two of the millions of factors involved. It is a serious lie. Even if we achieved all the cuts in emissions proposed, the effect would be a temperature change of probably less than 0.07 degrees Celsius, and, because of the millions of other factors, it might not happen anyway"
Philip Stott,United Kingdom,https://www.desmog.com/philip-stott/,"In face of the reality of change, we need a new agenda, not one based on illusory ideas of sustainable development and stability, but rather one on the dynamics of adaptability and flexible development.

James Taylor,United States,https://www.desmog.com/james-taylor/,"So how can Taylor make this claim? Well, as usual, it’s to cherry-pick a very, very specific set of circumstances: Satellite measurements of a single layer of the atmosphere.

Seriously. It’s just complete fertilizer."
James Taylor,United States,https://www.desmog.com/james-taylor/,"This is an inaccurate and misleading report.

James Taylor,United States,https://www.desmog.com/james-taylor/,"Japan, Korea and China all experienced extremely hot summers in 2013. Studies of these events concluded that human-caused climate change made these heat waves more likely.

Stanford soon gutted its core curriculum and caved to the ceaseless demands for ‘diversity,’ but Thiel and the Stanford Review were there to push back. The paper provided well-reasoned opposing views and exposed the intolerance of so many multiculturalists."

Got a Ph.D. in econ., medical degree, then just like became a tenured prof. at Stanford in health policy, and spent, you know decades plugging away, you know, writing various papers and books on, you know, what didn’t work about socialist medicine of one sort or another and then you know really found his voice in the last year or two as someone who started to question some of the conventional wisdom on COVID, and and you know it began with him just a lot of just very nuanced debates about, you know, was the infection rate higher and therefore was the mortality rate lower, and therefore was the panic overdone? You know, if you were prioritizing COVID above everything else, you know, how much, how many cancer patients were dying, how many people, and all other cases were not being taken care of, were we sort of getting these very basic cost-benefit calculations right We sort of, you can sort of imagine how the movie roughly ended. It ended with posters of his face plastered around campus, you know, this sort of this terribly evil person. You know, probably the hope was that someone would muster up the courage and maybe beat him up on sight or something like that. Normally, it’s probably mostly Kayfabe and LARPing, but, that’s sort of what people are hoping I guess.

And then, you know, and then there could be sort of a debate about this which of course never, never happens, and one then suspects that, you know, the sort of natural suspicion I always have is that if we can’t have a debate about the high-quality, whether the evidence is high quality or not, that tells us the evidence probably wasn’t high-quality and that he’s probably simply, simply right And of course, more generally raises questions about just this very, very strange way in which, you know, the mob goes against the individual in which, you know, the consensus theories of truth seem to misfire so badly in our society where, you know, when we look back, you know, a year, year and a half later, I think he was more right than wrong on these things as far as I can tell. It’s still complicated. Certainly, there was something deranged about a debate in which you could not have these sorts of, you could not have these sorts of discussions. And you know if you want to frame it politically, we always think of, you know, democracy as a good thing. In a democracy the majority is more right than wrong and if you get you know 51 percent is more right than 49, and 70 percent is even more right.

And we’ve had a dogmatic, maybe an atheist church in science, a dogmatic church that has nevertheless had crazed hairpin turns in the last year.

Peter Thiel,United States,https://www.desmog.com/peter-thiel/,"It’s a tremendous privilege to be back here as we reconvene from a little over two years ago. And there are so many different things we could talk about, but perhaps the theme I would want to start with is some reflections on the incredible derangement of various forms of thought, political life, scientific life, the sense-making machinery generally in this country over the last few years, and what we can perhaps do to counteract this derangement, what can be done, what must be done Maybe, you know maybe, there’s sort of many anecdotes one can start with, but I thought I’d start with one that involves you know, good friend of mine from undergraduate days at Stanford. Jay Bhattacharya, he sort of ended up pursuing sort of center-right, vaguely Libertarian, ended up pursuing an academic career. Got a Ph.D. in econ, medical degree, eventually became a tenured prof. at Stanford in health policy, and spent, you know, decades plugging away, you know, writing various papers and books on, you know, what didn’t work about socialist medicine of one sort or another and then you know really found his voice in the last year or two as someone who started to question some of the conventional wisdom on COVID, and and you know it began with him just a lot of just very nuanced debates about, you know, was the infection rate higher and therefore was the mortality rate lower, and therefore was the panic overdone?

Where do these things shift, becoming, you know, a mob, or racket, or simply something that’s, you know, a totalitarian lie. And there’s sort of, you know, in the philosophy of science, sort of the, you know, one of the ways I think you sort of frame it is that science always thinks of itself as fighting a two-front war against extreme skepticism and extreme dogmatism. Sort of the way it originated in the 17th and 18th centuries. So extreme skepticism, if I say, you know, I don’t believe the audience exists, I don’t can’t trust my senses, you can’t do science. Extreme dogmatism, you know, the Aristotelian notation that the Earth can’t possibly move, that’s probably also bad for science. And of course, in its, you know 18th-century version where the scientists style themselves as deists and rationalists and free thinkers of various types, it was always the fight against dogmatism that was what dominated, and in a very I think paradoxical turn that is still, you know, the way they think of themselves, even though if you sort of say where it’s gotten unbalanced and erred is obviously just become massively on the side of dogmatism. Not enough skepticism at all. And, you know, you see this of course in all the genuflections to science with a capital S. You know, ‘In this household we believe in Science,’ that’s sort of an evidence that you don’t, or just even just the assert… I always think that, you know, when you have to call things science, you know they aren’t, like climate science or political science. We don’t use physical science or chemical science because, you know, you don’t need to push a point that hard And, this sort of, you know, extreme dogmatism, you know, has of course, it’s not even been of a very stable variety like maybe, you know, the Catholic Church and its anti-Aristotelian notions, or its Aristotelian notions on Earth, you know it didn’t shift itself every month or every year on this. And we’ve had a dogmatic, maybe an atheist church in science, a dogmatic church that has nevertheless had crazed hairpin turns in the last year. Just on the COVID thing, they’re too many to enumerate, but just, you know, the very basic ones are, you know, masks first ineffective, then required. You know, vaccines, one year ago, Kamala Harris was campaigning that, you know, she would never take a Trump vaccine. Now they’re mandatory And of course, of course there’s the strange history of the lab leak where it was first racist and taboo, now it’s probably correct even though I’m not totally certain I’m allowed to discuss that yet, but it’s sort of, it’s probably sort of allowed to discuss this. And this sort of dogmatism, these hairpin turns, this sort of epistemic closure, is I think one of the ways that things have just gotten deranged over and over and over again And I want to maybe just go in the COVID example, I want to go through maybe two other ones. One that was sort of the, a very dramatic one, where I think, which is the… sort of incredible collapse of the absurdist postmodern experiment that was called Afghanistan. And, where, you know, if we discuss it in terms of military tactics, or you know, they didn’t defend the Air Force base or stuff like that, we’re missing what went wrong. What went wrong were, you know, 20 years of this sort of extreme epistemic closure of, you couldn’t dissent, you couldn’t really ask questions about what we were doing, and then you ended up in some, you know, bizarre, absurdist place There’s sort of many different, you know, we spent two trillion dollars, you know, there’s this sort of artificial country we created, propped up. There’s all sorts of crazed anecdotes I sort of found in putting the speech together, you know, two of… one of my bizarro… the super bizarro one was some NGO, you can look this up on YouTube, these are not, you know, things from The Onion as far as I can tell. But you can look it up on YouTube, it’s a NGO offering art studies, they’re going to the Duchamp toilet exhibit from 100 years ago where he just puts a toilet in a museum and they’re explaining to people in Afghanistan why this was an important moment in modern art Of course, this gets translated into Pashto, and then, you know, people are sort of not quite sure what they’re doing there, but, and then of course we had you know, we had the last president who got his Ph.D. from Columbia University wrote a book called, ‘Fixing Failed States,’ again this in even more The Onion episode. And then as the Taliban was closing in on Kabul, he held urgent meetings about ‘digitizing’ the Afghan economy But of course, you know, in general it was just this lie that we were building, you know, a liberal democracy that this was, you know, just history was on the side of people. And if we again want to sort of focus on a dissenting individual voice that articulated the alternative in very clear terms, in ways I will also quote, it would have been president Trump. It was articulated maybe at a late date, we can debate whether it could have still been course corrected, but he said that Afghanistan was fundamentally and irreducibly a ‘shithole country.’ And, you know, you know, I would never say this myself. I would never, you know, and there was a reason he was sort of out on a limb in saying that. Most of us wouldn’t say this. It’s not a very nice thing to say. It’s not clear that it’s a very rigorous scientific description. But certainly in a world where that question couldn’t be debated, couldn’t be discussed, is he right? Is this an accurate description of the country? Is the two trillion dollars just sort of throwing good money after bad? That’s the kind of world in which, you know, the whole thing ends in this crazy way. The mob, the individual is right, the mob sort of silenced the argument, and then, you know, it works until at some point it just, you get to this point of crazed total collapse Now I think, you know, there’s sort of a way in which, you know, Afghanistan is sort of this far away country we don’t know much about. There’s a way in which you could think of COVID as sort of, you know, strange questions of health policy, but maybe I will end on one where I think the epistemic closure is even bigger. It’s maybe, it maybe involves, it involves our, you know, perhaps our most sacred institution, our most high-functioning deep state institution, you know, one we can’t ask questions about at all and therefore we should suspect functions worse than almost all the others. And it’s one that I think, you know, to some extent is accessible more and more on this common-sense level, and I’m thinking of sort of the runaway non-transitory inflation that’s happening in this country, and the complete bankruptcy of the Fed. And, you know, it’s sort of, it’s again, we have this sort of epistemic closure in the form of everybody jumping onto MMT [modern monetary theory] theories, or, you know, theories that you can print as much money as you want so there will never be inflation at of course precisely the moment when they’re wrong. Precisely the moment when no dissent is allowed. I’ve sort of, you know, I think one of my sort of incredibly big misses of the last decade, I did some, but not as much as I should have, was not buying enough bitcoin, not buying enough crypto, and you know it’s $60,000 a bitcoin and still not sure that one should aggressively buy it, but surely what it is telling us is that we are at a crisis moment for the Fed. It is a canary in the coal mine. It is, the crypto market is the pure money market and it is telling us that the epistemically closed bubble around fiat money in the US is heading towards some crisis point You know, the Wizard of Oz is always this metaphor on Fed, on central banking, and I’ve sort of thought that maybe we’re close to a Toto moment in the Fed, where the little dog is pulling the curtain aside from, you know, the holy of holies, and you realize that there’s nobody there, nothing’s really going on. And we’ve had sort of these preliminary questions about the nature of the stock trading and things like this, and, you know, without going into the details of that, it’s when you start asking these questions, you know the institution is in trouble, that it is so over its limb, so out on a limb, and so much at a point where something is going to break. And again, the problem, whether it’s Fed, Afghanistan, COVID, is that we’ve, we have this sort of, these machines for generating consensus, uniformity, you know, and not asking dissident questions even though they’re super urgent and as far as I can tell, the hour is late for all of these institutions, and it’s more urgent than ever that we find a way to have some of these dissident voices get heard in all these different contexts And so, you know, there’s sort of a, you can frame the skepticism dogmatism or the, you know, wisdom of crowds vs madness of crowds. We’re on the side of the madness of crowds, we’re on the side of excess dogmatism, you know, there’s sort of a centralization, decentralization, is there too much decentralization? No it’s way too much centralization of, you know, is it too much misinformation, are there too many crazy dissidents? No. It’s too much the Ministry of Truth. And so yes, maybe there is some theoretical debate, but in practice, it is, you know, if there’s, you know, if there’s a misinformation problem, it’s a centralized misinformation problem, and it’s the misinformation coming from the Ministry of Truth, whether that ministry is telling us things about COVID, or about Afghanistan, or that there’s no inflation at all, even, you know, even to the, even going against what everyone says Now, relating this a little bit to the theme of this conference, of the question of nationalism. It strikes me that one of the ways the question of nationalism always gets misperceived is that it is, it is seen as not so much on the side of individuals or classical liberalism or even conservatism, and yet this seems to be very wrong because the place where we have the worst mobs, the most homogenized forms of thinking possible are, in the context of globalization, and if we think of nationalism as a corrective to the sort of, you know, homogenizing, you know, brain-dead one-world state that’s totalitarian and where there’s no dissent, no individualism is allowed, it is the sort of all-important corrective at this point. And I keep thinking that the worst forms of this sort of fake consensus, fake dangerous centralization Ministry of Truth are all the globalist versions. You know, to make this even more self-referential to the attendees here, I’ve… I was sort of reflecting on, you know, the World Economic Forum, the Davos Conference, where, you know, I last went in 2013 and the sort of insight I had there was sort of interesting where you have all these different people, but they represent, you know, companies, or maybe they represent, maybe they’re the heads of states they represent a government, a country, they might represent, you know, in various contexts they represent of course lots of NGOs. But there are no individuals, and there’s virtually nobody who’s simply representing themselves and thinking for themselves, and saying, ‘This is what I believe. This is not… Nobody agrees with me on this, but this is… I’ve just been looking at the facts and the data and thinking about it myself and this is what I’ve concluded. And it’s sort of a picture of a globalist future in which individuals, you know, will not exist, and it will just be some kind of a braindead Borg. And I think the character of this conference will be the exact opposite of that. We have, you know, all sorts of individuals here, I hope they will not agree with one another. I hope that we will have, you know, incredibly, incredibly vigorous debates and that this is the sort of thing that is needed if we’re going to course correct in this country. And, you know, so I don’t know what metaphor you want to use, but it’s sort of the, you know, the Biden administration is sort of like the Titanic in which we have the zombie retreads from, you know, the Clinton and Obama administrations. I mean people like Larry Summers, even Larry Summers is probably too heterodox to be allowed, and we sort of have the zombie retreads that are just busy rearranging the deck chairs, you know, maybe mopping the floors on the deck or something like that. You know, captain’s reading from the teleprompter, just always North, due North, steady as she goes, and, you know, we need some, you know, we need some dissident voices more than ever Let me, maybe, I will just end with sort of a fantasy of mine of what victory would look like, and I don’t think this will happen, and, or it’s a long ways off. But if… You know, I would like us to go back to a country in which we have ticker tape parades for single individuals. We haven’t had such a ticker tape parade in the 21st century, and individuals not just sports stars, not just individuals who might even be American, who might even be doing things that are changing society, asking dangerous questions, inventing things, and my candidate for the first such person we should do a ticker tape parade for, and he or she may well not show up, but we should still do it, my candidate is Satoshi Nakamoto.

Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/thomas-jefferson-institute-public-policy/,"There are four truths to the climate change policy debate that the debaters do not really want you to know. The first is that greenhouse gas reduction goals, like Governor Kaine’s are both unachievable and irrelevant."
Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/thomas-jefferson-institute-public-policy/,"[…] If the carbon and energy reduction goals are unachievable and, from a scientific perspective, irrelevant, are we condemned to suffer a climate catastrophe? Enter the Second climate change truth; there will be no climate catastrophe due to CO2 because either the science is wrong or we will use geoengineering."
Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/thomas-jefferson-institute-public-policy/,[…] the third truth; we are going to see a federally mandated climate response.  This will be a federal program that will subsume the nascent state and regional efforts to cap-and-trade carbon emissions.
Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/thomas-jefferson-institute-public-policy/,"[…]So what is the fourth climate change truth? It is that we are going to see important environmental actions sacrificed on the altar of global warming response. We have seen the cuts in Virginia’s environmental programs already. This is because, when push comes to shove, most folks consider current environmental problems, like Chesapeake Bay restoration, to be luxuries."
Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/thomas-jefferson-institute-public-policy/,"This is no time for political games. Climate change is not an immediate threat to humanity. Climate-related deaths have declined 98.9% in the last century, and humanity is growing more and more resilient thanks to the availability of affordable, reliable energy. On behalf of all Americans, we urge you to oppose any stimulus proposals that carve out special treatment for or bail out any energy companies and focus instead on stopping COVID-19."
Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/thomas-jefferson-institute-public-policy/,"With continuing controversy surrounding oil, natural gas and coal production, nuclear power is an energy supply that should be, and could be, safely developed to meet much of Virginia’s future electrical power needs,"
Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/thomas-jefferson-institute-public-policy/,"Due to the amazing number of nuclear related facilities and Virginia’s critical infrastructure related to national security, it makes perfect sense that Virginia should lead the way in nuclear technology and new and innovative ideas to provide safe and secure power that is also, if necessary, off grid,"
Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy,United States,https://www.desmog.com/thomas-jefferson-institute-public-policy/,"According to Judith Curry […] we just don’t know. […] For the last 18 years, the global temperature has been level. Hasn’t gone up, hasn’t gone down. We don’t know what’s going to happen for the next 18 years. It could go up; it could go down. What we need to do is figure out how to plan so that whatever happens, we’re doing something sensible. The clean power plan itself is problematic in that it costs so much money, and will upset some of the work we do on our electric grid to such a degree that we need to have enormous confidence that the kind of changes the EPA currently wants make good sense. For example, if we want to get rid of carbon, one of the best solutions would be to go to nuclear energy. The science is still out. I’m a Ph.D. scientist, and people say ‘well, you’re a skeptic’ and my answer is ‘well, all scientists are skeptics. That’s what being a scientist is.’ And, so when you hear a consensus saying ‘gee, we think this is a big problem,’ and then you actually look at the real science, and you find out, gosh, the temperature has not gone the way we predicted it would, we have to go back and ask ‘how are our assumptions doing? Are we really right?’ And when we’re talking about the size of investment we’re talking about, we need to have a great deal of confidence. What we have though are opportunities to make sensible changes. […] What we need to do in the final call is have a good public discussion about this. And, when you do, you find people are not willing to go any further than they have to because of the other expenses in life."

Holger Thuss,Germany,https://www.desmog.com/holger-thuss/,"[H]umans have had no measurable effect on global warming through CO2 emissions. Instead the temperature fluctuations have been within normal ranges and are due to natural cycles. Indeed the atmosphere has not warmed since 1998 – more than 10 years, and the global temperature has even dropped significantly since 2003."

And on the other end of the debate I certainly would say to absolutists who say there is absolutely no relationship. And the truth of the matter based on our investigation is it’s somewhere in between limate science is probably one of the most extraordinarily complex areas of scientific study that anyone can undertake. The variables are numerous. Many of the variables are measurable and – and we can replicate models. Many of the variables we cannot measure them. We cannot model them but we know they’re part of the climate system. And so the models are extraordinarily complicated. And therefore how certain do you feel about the competency of the model and its ability to predict the future. And it’s my view that the models have become increasingly more competent because of high speed computing capabilities and just more sophisticated mathematical modelling and more data to inform the model. But at the end of it there are still a range of uncertain outcomes around these models. And every scientist I know agrees there’s a range of uncertainty.

First of all, we’re not giving anything away, and the problem people have when they’re looking at the analysis is that they forget that this is one of many, many regulations that we implemented in the clean air act, so this regulation is directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and that’s exactly what it would do. ou know, it’s true that regulations like this would have a secondary effect of, you know, affecting emissions of other pollutants, but we have ample and abundant regulatory authority to deal with all the pollution that we’re responsible for under the clean air act. And, in this case, the proposed ACE rule would be very effective in dealing with greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and it would complement the broad suite of other very aggressive standards we have in place for other types of pollution. nnouncer: “So which plan would take more pollution out of the atmosphere? The Trump administration’s plan, or the Obama administration’s plan? ehrum: “Probably the ACE rule, without a doubt. The Trump administration plan. Because the Obama administration plan never got implemented. So it was promulgated as a regulation and then immediately stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court in an unprecedented move by the court.

That’s not what this is about. This is an exercise in being as smart as we possibly can and as effective as we possibly can in regulating. What we’re not doing, which is what the Obama administration did, is put a thumb on the scale. They actively tried to put the coal industry out of business. nnouncer: “What’s wrong with that? I guess that’s what I’m asking. […] I guess what I’m asking is what’s wrong with letting coal go in favor of cleaner sources of energy? ehrum: “Right. But there’s a difference in letting the market decide and let people decide how they want to generate power versus using the federal government power to push people out of business. So we’re not pushing anybody out of business, but we’re not favoring anybody We’re letting the market decide, and when you look at the market as a whole, there’s a big shift. I mean there’s a fundamental change happening as we speak, as we’re watching, in the power sector. What’s happening is American ingenuity has allowed for the production of phenomenal amounts of good, clean, cheap natural gas, and the power industry is responding. And what you’re seeing is a shift out of coal, a shift out of oil, a shift into gas, and a corresponding but lesser shift into renewables nd the overall effect, you know, without the hand of government touching it is you’re seeing a fundamental shift in the power sector. So, you know, that’s what we believe. We believe that we should let the markets operate, and in this case the markets are operating in a way that achieves real efficiencies from an economic standpoint, makes for a lot of cheap power which is great for this country.

So it’s definitely easy to square those two together, because the more natural gas we produce domestically, we can export it overseas, we can use it here at home, and it’s clean burning, and it reduces greenhouse gas emissions."

Clearly the United States. Through technological innovation and private-sector investment, the US is threatening the energy dominance of OPEC and Russia, with all the associated positive geo-political implications. Along with the increased production comes job and economic growth; the oil and natural gas industry is responsible for one out of every five new private-sector jobs and contributes $1.1 trillion to U.S. GDP annually We’re also leading on global warming policy. Because of abundant natural gas, the United States has increased natural gas electricity generation which has enabled us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to 1992 levels.

Before the Industrial Revolution, humanity depended on burning wood and candle wax. But with the ability to harness the energy in oil and other fossil fuels, quality of life and capacity for progress increased exponentially. Thanks to incredible innovations in the energy industry, fossil fuels are as promising, safe, and clean an energy resource as has ever existed in history. Yet, highly politicized climate policies are pushing a grand-scale shift to unreliable, impractical, incredibly expensive, and far less efficient energy sources. Today, ‘fossil fuel’ has become such a dirty word that even fossil fuel companies feel compelled to apologize for their products. In Fueling Freedom, energy experts Stephen Moore and Kathleen Hartnett White make an unapologetic case for fossil fuels, turning around progressives’ protestations to prove that if fossil fuel energy is supplanted by ‘green’ alternatives for political reasons, humanity will take a giant step backwards and the planet will be less safe, less clean, and less free."

Even if this turns out to be an exaggeration — even if the alarmist view of global warming turns out to be wrong on the substance and recent variation is all a matter of Milankovitch cycles or solar activity — wouldn’t we be better off adopting the reforms that the wise and holy men put forward? Wouldn’t it be better — morally better — if we consumed less, made a little less go a little farther, conserved, burned less oil and coal, exploited fewer natural resources, and exercised a little of what the old virtue-mongers used to call continence Better for whom Certainly not better for the poor, who, we have it on good authority, shall always be among us. (Jesus was a pretty good economist, but I believe that He may have gotten that one wrong: Poverty is, in fact, a solvable problem.) Technological and economic regression is almost always borne by those with the least power to forcibly pass along costs to other parties, and that ensures that forgone gains in the quality of material life will burden the poor rather than the well-off, whatever formal agreement is forged in or after Paris. But this exercise in virtue isn’t really about them — the poor and sweaty and miserable Them, who when they are not foundering in picturesque poverty are scheming to (sing along, Senator Sanders!) steal our jobs.

Wayne Winegarden,United States,https://www.desmog.com/wayne-winegarden/,"Even if the U.S. implemented a carbon cap, worldwide carbon emissions may not be reduced; instead, the likely outcome is that carbon emissions will be simply redistributed from the U.S. to places like China and India. The economic costs borne by U.S. residents will consequently be borne in vain as there would be no net positive impact on the environment from the carbon cap policy. In fact, to the extent that the industrialized countries use cleaner technologies, the regulations could actually have a net negative impact on the environment."

It’s either neutral or in fact it may be benign. It may be a good thing. It’s a good thing we got out of the little ice age, for example Pat Michaels, I have to mention, is a leading lukewarmer. In fact, I can plug his new book called lukewarming, which published by Cato quite recently. I recommend it highly. I am neither. I am a true skeptic. Although, it’s a little tricky because, ah, and this is where my, I guess my philosophical training comes in, it’s not a question of saying it’s humans are not affecting the climate. It’s more a matter of saying we don’t know what affect humans are having on the climate. In other words, it’s not a claim, it’s a concern. It’s an open question."

The origin of the theory of global warming (for it is just a theory) lies in taking the thermometer readings we happen to have from the last 100 years and massaging them in various ways. Some places have clearly warmed, others have clearly cooled. Many have gone up and down but with little apparent trend. To get a global result requires a lot of statistical manipulation.

World Climate Report,United States,https://www.desmog.com/world-climate-report/,"Fact No. 1. The rate of global warming during the past several decades has been about 0.18ºC per decade. There is no evidence that this rate is increasing. If this continues to the end of the 21st century, the temperature increase will be about 1.8ºC. Some fraction of this warming is a result of natural fluctuations in the earth’s climate as well as from other non-greenhouse-related changes (changes in land use, urbanization, industrialization, data quality, etc.); there is evidence that controls on black carbon (soot) pollution could result in less warming. A warming of this magnitude is near the low end of the range of projections issued in 2001 by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Associated with a low-end warming are low-end projections of sea-level rise and other types of environmental changes Fact No. 2. During the past several decades, the earth’s vegetation has responded in an overwhelmingly positive fashion to changes in the earth’s climate. On average the growing season has lengthened (primarily by beginning earlier in the spring) and the total plant biomass has increased by about 10 percent. This remarkable growth enhancement has been due both to the fertilization effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide as well as the beneficial effects of the patterns of climate change across the globe Fact No. 3. During the past several decades, anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide have continued to rise, but the rate of build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has leveled off. That means that the earth’s biosphere has responded by increasing the rate of carbon dioxide uptake. This is evidenced by Fact No. 2—enhanced global plant growth Fact No. 4. During the past several decades (and more), human technological advances have kept pace with, and in most cases exceeded the rate of climate change—no matter what the cause. For example, in major U.S. cities, where the thermal effects of urbanization are many times larger than the effects of any climate change, the population has become less sensitive to periods of extremely high temperature (heat waves). This is documented through declining heat wave mortality. In fact, today, many U.S. urban areas experience no increases in mortality during heat waves—a situation that was vastly different only 20 to 30 years ago."

You know, you’re going to have which essentially impact what our economic growth is, which was what was happening to my customer base. So I actually had some of our customers and a couple other people that said, hey, we’ll volunteer our time if if we can get the Railroad Commission to accept us to come in and help write guidance documents for staff members to kind of follow. So we get to a better level playing field and timeliness and making sure that our economy’s moving along and that that is not held up, waiting on decisions by the Railroad Commission because somebody is inexperienced. And I actually went up I talked to one of the commissioners and they said, yeah, we think that’s a great idea. We’ll give you access to staff. Well, lo and behold, to us, we didn’t meet one staff member that really wanted to work with an outside task force to write guidance documents. They were adamantly against that. So the task force that I formed looked at me since I was a guy that formed it and said, Jim, we you know, we really, really would like to make these changes and would you consider running for Railroad Commission? That was in July of 2019. It was actually December 6th […] n an interview with The Texan, Wright said industry members had told him “You have been involved with, not only all the energy sector, but really involved with oil and gas — since discovery of the shale — you know how the nuts and bolts work out here.

Jim Wright,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jim-wright/,"Simply said the real issues that we experienced last week was not the failure of the oil and gas industry, but it is complicated. We have we have a system that is generated by different sources, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, and we have natural gas that supplies, our demand for electrical generation, and we also have coal. And the way that we have it set up in priority by mandate is we have to allow those renewable energy sources, wind and solar, at least 20 percent of manufacturing the electrical requirements for the state of Texas. Now, whether that comes, you know, at the same time natural gas does and that’s rarely the occurrence because of wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine. So what happens to people that use natural gas or coal, as you may know, are very reliable sources and generation of electricity. They have to they have to bring those down to to meet that quota of that 20 percent and the renewable energy sources. So you may have months that that happens quite a bit again, because of wind’s not blowing or the sun’s not shining. So it’s not something that people that are in the business of generating electricity can rely on. On how much electricity demand on sale today and how much just going to sell tomorrow. So, as you know, an investor that we would have an interest in putting in a reliable source using coal or natural gas would be discouraged because you can’t really perform what that success would be in the capital required to do that. So what I think when you look at kind of what happened to us last week, that’s that’s one of the reasons that that occurred. … I think we need to lean on legislature a little bit to get to the bottom of exactly what occurred. And I think the answer to that’s going to be that we need to look at how we allow renewable, that access, onto the grid and maybe not not allow that to happen. … They also need to put attention on how can we encourage reliable energy use in our electrical generation if we’re going to stop this? The bottom line, I think, for everyone in Texas to realize is that all of those options are probably going to equate to higher consumer cost for us when it comes to electricity. […] So you ask what industry can do? I think we need to get out and advocate or advocate for our legislatures to really take a hard look at how we’ve structured, who gets priority system and how do we encourage that we get to an aging grid system upgrade and how do we encourage people to come in and generate more electricity, which would be good for our industry, because I think natural gas is the most reliable, abundant source that we have today for that generation."

Jim Wright,United States,https://www.desmog.com/jim-wright/,"But as far as its impact on our atmosphere, CO2 is something that is our atmosphere. You know, in CO2 has evolved as the world has evolved. You know, from the history that I read, you know the dinosaur ages, and you see the vegetation that that I’ve read about in history. CO2 promotes vegetation growth. It’s just it’s part of what we experience. It’s part of being on the Earth.

Gregory Wrightstone,United States,https://www.desmog.com/gregory-wrightstone/,"During nearly all of Earth’s history, carbon dioxide concentration was at many multiples of our current level, averaging 2,600 ppm, or 6.5 times our current measurement. Forerunners of most of the plants we rely on for sustenance first appeared around 150 million years ago when CO2 levels were more than 2,000 ppm. Since that time CO2 has fallen steadily and precipitously In fact, at the end of the last ice age, carbon dioxide reached the dangerously low level of 182 ppm, thought to be the lowest since the Pre-Cambrian time period more than 600 million years ago. Why is it dangerous? Because 150 ppm is the lowest level at which plant life can survive. We came within a whisker of breaching that ‘line of death.’ Until we began adding CO2 to the atmosphere, there was no guarantee that this horrific threshold would not be crossed in the future Rather than spreading fear of increasing carbon dioxide, we should be thankful that both the Earth and humanity are thriving, in part due to more CO2 … Although I do not pretend to speak for the planet’s flora, I am quite certain that, if plants had a say in the matter, they would not lobby for reductions in CO2 levels.
